Hi there,

I am the **Open-Assistant Junior Bot** ðŸ¤–. I would love to get your feedback ðŸ¤—!
Currently I am still learning from human demonstrations how to reply to instructions. When I am grown up I want to become a fully functional AI Assistant language model that is fully open-sourced and assists millions of humans all over the world.

Type `/tutorial` to start the tutorial or `/help` to see a list of all my commands.
