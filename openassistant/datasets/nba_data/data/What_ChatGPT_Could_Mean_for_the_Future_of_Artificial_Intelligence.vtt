WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
The Joe Rogan experience.

00:02.640 --> 00:06.140
But I want to talk about chat GPT.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.640
Mmm.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.140
Fascinating question.

00:09.140 --> 00:09.640
Yeah.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.640
Have you experimented with it at all?

00:10.640 --> 00:11.640
I have not.

00:11.640 --> 00:18.720
But someone, the gentleman who runs the JRE companion page,

00:18.720 --> 00:22.880
made a rap with chat GPT.

00:22.880 --> 00:28.760
Like, was it if Kanye West wrote a rap for chat GPT?

00:28.760 --> 00:30.200
They put it on Instagram.

00:30.200 --> 00:35.560
But it seems like a person saying it.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.400
Like.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.640
You want to try it?

00:37.640 --> 00:39.120
No.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.000
We could try it.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.120
I mean, it takes a long time.

00:41.120 --> 00:41.720
Not really.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.960
His thing took, like, 48 minutes to do.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.640
Well, whatever you want to look up right now, we can do it.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.760
Yeah, the problem is you have to cajole it.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.160
It'll get something wrong.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.120
And you have to say no, not that.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.360
But let's just explain what it is.

00:52.360 --> 00:59.280
So chat GPT is a large language model trained artificial

00:59.280 --> 01:04.280
intelligence, which is, let's just say, it can be awful.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.800
But it is often surprisingly good at answering questions

01:09.800 --> 01:12.200
you might have about how to do things.

01:12.200 --> 01:16.440
One of the great triumphs of it is that coders are now asking

01:16.440 --> 01:18.360
it to solve coding problems.

01:18.360 --> 01:22.200
And it will actually write code that is functional.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.080
It's pretty amazing.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.520
And it also, there's an implementation of it, that if

01:26.520 --> 01:30.880
you feed it up to three tweets, it will write a New York

01:30.880 --> 01:35.560
Times story in one of five genres, optimistic,

01:35.560 --> 01:37.560
pessimistic, neutral.

01:37.560 --> 01:42.520
And you don't really need the New York Times anymore,

01:42.520 --> 01:45.160
because it's pretty good at this job.

01:45.160 --> 01:48.320
So on the one hand, it's all very interesting that we're

01:48.320 --> 01:53.520
living in an era in which there is at least, and this is a

01:53.520 --> 01:55.240
prototype, right?

01:55.240 --> 01:57.800
This is a prototype that was specifically trained and then

01:57.800 --> 01:59.800
placed on the internet so people could play with it.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.880
And I've seen lots of interesting uses.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.520
It's going to get better, right?

02:05.520 --> 02:07.600
We're dealing with chat GPT-3.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.160
There's going to be a chat GPT-4, which is going to be

02:10.160 --> 02:13.520
that much better, because it will be built with the

02:13.520 --> 02:17.160
improvements that have been gained through turning this

02:17.160 --> 02:18.640
one loose on the world.

02:18.640 --> 02:25.360
But I have to say, I am quite alarmed.

02:25.360 --> 02:30.440
Not only that this thing exists, but I don't think we're

02:30.440 --> 02:32.200
ready for it.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.440
And I don't think we're ready for it in a

02:33.440 --> 02:35.440
couple different ways.

02:35.440 --> 02:39.560
If you want to comfort yourself and say, well, this isn't

02:39.560 --> 02:42.760
that serious that we have this AI that can do these really

02:42.760 --> 02:46.440
shocking things, the comforting thing is that the way

02:46.440 --> 02:48.960
it's programmed, it doesn't know what it's saying.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.120
It doesn't matter that it convinces you that it's

02:52.120 --> 02:55.280
saying something and it means it and that it seems like a

02:55.280 --> 02:56.880
creative entity.

02:56.880 --> 03:01.280
What it's doing is it is basically using a predictive

03:01.280 --> 03:05.520
model that has been trained on a huge data set of written

03:05.520 --> 03:06.680
language, right?

03:06.680 --> 03:12.120
So the answer is, if you take three words in a row, can

03:12.120 --> 03:14.080
you predict what the next word is going to be?

03:14.080 --> 03:15.080
And they've allowed it.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.520
They've exposed it to a large data set.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.440
And it's gotten really good at predicting basically these

03:19.440 --> 03:22.280
sequences to the point that it can now, if you're prompted

03:22.280 --> 03:28.480
correctly, it can spit out these very long explanations.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.680
Some of them are dead wrong.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.200
Sometimes they're right on target.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.160
But I have two concerns about it.

03:35.160 --> 03:38.480
One, if you imagine that this thing just gets a little

03:38.480 --> 03:43.120
better than it is, which is inevitable, that it's going to

03:43.120 --> 03:51.280
make actual insight that much harder to spot.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.720
In other words, if you become expert at operating this

03:54.720 --> 03:58.040
thing, at querying it, and it becomes better at understanding

03:58.040 --> 04:00.800
a wider range of topics because they turn it loose on

04:00.800 --> 04:03.920
everything that's written on the internet, for example,

04:03.920 --> 04:08.040
then the point is the ability to fake expertise is going to

04:08.040 --> 04:10.280
go through the roof.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.280
I don't think we know how we're going to police a world in

04:13.280 --> 04:16.640
which this problem is already bad enough.

04:16.640 --> 04:21.280
Most academics are fakers.

04:21.280 --> 04:23.000
They don't know that.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.320
They trained in something.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.920
They wrote a dissertation.

04:25.920 --> 04:26.960
They think they're experts.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.920
But you can see when something unexpected happens, like the

04:29.920 --> 04:34.280
pandemic, you get just broad-scale failure across

04:34.280 --> 04:38.400
entire disciplines, where nobody seems to get it right.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.760
So in that world, this is going to be even worse, because now

04:41.760 --> 04:45.880
you have some artificial intelligence able to generate

04:45.880 --> 04:50.320
things in plain English that are often full of true

04:50.320 --> 04:54.520
information, but you don't know whether what generated it is

04:54.520 --> 05:00.360
some brain-dead model or something else.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.000
That's one concern.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.440
And then the other concern is when we say, well, chatGPT

05:08.440 --> 05:10.360
doesn't know what it's saying.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.600
It's not conscious.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.760
We know it's not conscious, because it's not programmed

05:13.760 --> 05:16.240
to have a consciousness.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.680
We are actually ignoring the other half of the story, which

05:19.680 --> 05:22.400
is that we don't know how human consciousness works.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.000
And we don't know how it develops in a child.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.400
A child is exposed to a world of adults talking around them.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.480
And the child experiments first with full names and then words

05:35.480 --> 05:38.400
and then clusters of words and then sentences.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.120
And by doing something that isn't all that far from what

05:42.120 --> 05:48.120
chatGPT is doing, it ends up becoming a conscious individual.

05:48.120 --> 05:52.680
And so I think it's clear that chatGPT isn't conscious.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.720
It couldn't be.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.240
But it isn't clear to me, at least, that we are not

05:57.240 --> 06:02.640
suddenly stepping onto a process that produces that very

06:02.640 --> 06:05.480
quickly without us even necessarily knowing it.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.080
And what steps, if any, can be done to mitigate that

06:12.080 --> 06:13.880
at this point?

06:13.880 --> 06:15.840
Well, it's interesting.

06:15.840 --> 06:20.760
I wrote a paper, which I never published anywhere in 2016

06:20.760 --> 06:22.040
about this very issue.

06:22.040 --> 06:28.280
In fact, I used basically the argument that you could attain

06:28.280 --> 06:34.440
artificial general intelligence by imbuing computers with a

06:34.440 --> 06:38.120
childlike play environment for language and then exposing them

06:38.120 --> 06:41.000
to a huge data set, which is not exactly what's happened here,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.280
but it's in the ballpark.

06:44.280 --> 06:50.440
And I would argue, and I did argue, that one needs to build

06:50.440 --> 06:57.400
an architecture in which this can't get away from you.

06:57.400 --> 07:01.880
And so the architecture that I advocate for is actually a

07:01.880 --> 07:05.680
metamorphosis architecture, where metamorphosis is not

07:05.680 --> 07:06.160
allowed.

07:06.160 --> 07:11.960
It is an affirmative choice of humans.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.000
So in other words, if you think about, let's say that we

07:15.000 --> 07:20.920
developed some artificial frogs to do some job, to clear some

07:20.920 --> 07:23.400
waterway of something.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.040
And we imbued them with an intelligence so that they could

07:26.040 --> 07:27.720
learn to clear the waterway better.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.080
But we worried that they might learn to do something that we

07:30.080 --> 07:33.040
don't want them to do, and that we would have no way of

07:33.040 --> 07:35.560
arresting it once these frogs were released in the wild and

07:35.560 --> 07:37.640
capable of producing more of themselves.

07:37.640 --> 07:41.520
But if what you say is, well, at the point at which you go

07:41.520 --> 07:45.560
from a tadpole to a frog, you have to ask us if you can go.

07:45.560 --> 07:50.560
There's no automatic transition from a tadpole to a frog.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.360
There are still dangers.

07:52.360 --> 07:57.120
In the case of GPT chat, I think some of the artificial

07:57.120 --> 07:59.840
intelligence existential risk folks would tell you that one

07:59.840 --> 08:08.000
of the dangers is that the chat AI could convince you to do

08:08.000 --> 08:10.360
its bidding.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.680
As you said, when you were looking at this, it felt

08:12.680 --> 08:13.880
like a person.

08:13.880 --> 08:17.160
And the point is something that feels like a person can play

08:17.160 --> 08:19.120
on your emotions.

08:19.120 --> 08:24.520
Can that be used to cause a fail safe to be removed?

08:24.520 --> 08:25.760
Maybe.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.240
But in any case, this only deals with one of the two

08:29.240 --> 08:32.040
issues I'm raising, the question of actual artificial

08:32.040 --> 08:36.040
general intelligence arriving, us not knowing necessarily

08:36.040 --> 08:37.800
that it has.

08:37.800 --> 08:41.560
That's a frightening prospect.

08:41.560 --> 08:44.320
And in fact, I have a little thought experiment that might

08:44.320 --> 08:45.080
reveal why.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.280
But the other issue is the issue of competence.

08:49.280 --> 08:57.440
In a world where you basically have a serenade

08:57.440 --> 09:02.160
de Bergerac dystopia, where everybody is using this thing

09:02.160 --> 09:05.280
behind the scenes in order to say things that are beyond

09:05.280 --> 09:10.120
their own capacity to articulate, then the world

09:10.120 --> 09:12.680
becomes some new kind of hall of mirrors.

09:12.680 --> 09:17.840
We've had a hard enough time dealing with algorithms on

09:17.840 --> 09:19.880
search and feed.

09:19.880 --> 09:23.680
This is a whole next level of difficulty in knowing where

09:23.680 --> 09:26.080
you are and who you're talking to and what it means and what

09:26.080 --> 09:26.960
their motives are.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.760
And I think we ought to be on high alert.

09:30.760 --> 09:36.840
When you extrapolate, when you look at what this does and

09:36.840 --> 09:42.160
what it's capable of, and what I think scares people is

09:42.160 --> 09:46.640
something that seems to be a person but doesn't have any

09:46.640 --> 09:52.240
emotion, doesn't have any soul.

09:52.240 --> 09:57.520
It's not us, but it behaves exactly as us.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.040
And then you can put it in a physical entity.

10:00.040 --> 10:04.360
So if you have this chat GPT and then you extrapolate to

10:04.360 --> 10:09.640
version 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and then there's a physical thing

10:09.640 --> 10:15.080
that has this ability inside of it to communicate with you

10:15.080 --> 10:20.880
like ex machina, where it's exhibiting all of the behavior

10:20.880 --> 10:22.440
characteristics of a person.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.000
One of the most terrifying things, that's one of my

10:24.000 --> 10:25.040
favorite movies of all time.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.400
I love that movie.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.880
One of my favorite movies of all time was when that guy

10:29.880 --> 10:37.720
who was brought in to run some tests on these artificial

10:37.720 --> 10:43.560
intelligence creations and determine whether or not they

10:43.560 --> 10:44.840
pass as human.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.600
What does that test call again?

10:46.600 --> 10:47.080
Turing test.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.120
Turing test.

10:48.120 --> 10:52.280
And he is in love with this woman.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.560
She's manipulated him to the point where he's aided her

10:55.560 --> 10:56.640
in her escape.

10:56.640 --> 10:59.080
And then she leaves him in that room with the bulletproof

10:59.080 --> 11:00.680
glass and he's pounding on the glass.

11:00.680 --> 11:05.680
And she walks away with not a thought at all about him.

11:05.680 --> 11:10.640
It is the ultimate example of the worst case scenario of

11:10.640 --> 11:13.800
where this can go, where you have something that behaves

11:13.800 --> 11:19.400
exactly like a human being and knows how to play upon your

11:19.400 --> 11:24.160
sexual urges, your emotional desires, all of those different

11:24.160 --> 11:26.600
things that she plays upon.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.840
And then she just walks away from him and leaves him to

11:29.840 --> 11:34.520
starve to death in this fucking bulletproof room.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.960
Yeah.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.640
And I'm now recalling the film.

11:39.640 --> 11:44.080
And it's done very well because it manipulates you

11:44.080 --> 11:48.560
passively in your seat as it manipulates this character on

11:48.560 --> 11:49.600
the screen.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.360
And so you are betrayed too in this.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.600
You want to believe that it's emotional.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.640
And it has none of that.

11:55.640 --> 11:59.000
You feel bad for this woman, what you think is a woman,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.280
who is contained.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.240
And when she's sang to him when the power goes out, don't

12:04.240 --> 12:05.480
trust him.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.440
And then the power comes back on.

12:07.440 --> 12:08.560
She behaves normally again.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.400
You're like, oh my god.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.960
She's trapped.

12:11.960 --> 12:16.440
This poor creature, they've made a person, essentially.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.920
And she has these thoughts and hopes and dreams, just like a

12:19.920 --> 12:22.320
regular person, but now she's trapped.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.240
And he falls in love with her.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.480
And even though he's seen her in her robot form, when she

12:28.480 --> 12:32.800
puts skin on and when she puts clothes on and she's in front

12:32.800 --> 12:34.720
of him, he's in love with her.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.040
Right.

12:35.040 --> 12:40.560
And again, it plays very well because there's a

12:40.560 --> 12:45.480
manipulable circuit in straight men that's going to

12:45.480 --> 12:46.600
react to this.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.600
I'm sure straight women as well.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.040
I'm sure gay women, gay men.

12:49.040 --> 12:49.480
No doubt.

12:49.480 --> 12:49.720
No doubt.

12:49.720 --> 12:50.360
Everybody.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.000
Well, yes.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.480
But in this particular narrative, you have to be a gay

12:53.480 --> 12:56.560
woman or a straight man for it to trigger you.

12:56.560 --> 13:01.200
But A, part of this is actually inevitable in the chat

13:01.200 --> 13:06.440
GPT story because especially to the extent that this is a

13:06.440 --> 13:09.720
mindless entity that doesn't know what it's doing, it's

13:09.720 --> 13:12.360
just striving to do it better.

13:12.360 --> 13:16.080
The tactics that work will register as, oh, you did it

13:16.080 --> 13:16.840
right.

13:16.840 --> 13:20.600
So to the extent that you have those vulnerabilities in you

13:20.600 --> 13:23.960
and it finds them and that works, then the point is

13:23.960 --> 13:25.120
reinforcement.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.920
It scares us because it's not us, but it is us.

13:28.920 --> 13:29.280
Well.

13:29.280 --> 13:33.320
Because it's behaving exactly like us, but it doesn't have

13:33.320 --> 13:35.920
all the things that make a person a person.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.240
It doesn't have the biological vulnerabilities.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.480
It doesn't have the ability to actually sexually

13:41.480 --> 13:42.200
reproduce.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.880
It doesn't have emotions.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.800
It doesn't have all these different things that we like

13:45.800 --> 13:49.560
to think of, the soul, whatever that means, whatever that

13:49.560 --> 13:50.920
term actually means.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.040
Yeah.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.320
But I'm worried about what could be generated.

13:55.320 --> 13:58.120
And I know that that sounds, it will sound to a lot of people,

13:58.120 --> 14:01.160
especially technological people, like a biologist out of his

14:01.160 --> 14:02.080
depth.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.040
But I don't think so.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.360
This is a biologist trying to say something about the

14:05.360 --> 14:21.400
biology and what it applies about this analogous system.
