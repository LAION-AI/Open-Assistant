We're excited to announce the release of OpenAssistant!

The future of AI development depends heavily on high quality datasets and models
being made publicly available, and that's exactly what this project does.

Our team has worked tirelessly over the past several months collecting large
amounts of text-based input and feedback to create an incredibly diverse and
unique dataset designed specifically for training language models or other AI
applications.

With over 600k human-generated data points covering a wide range of topics and
styles of writing, our dataset will be an invaluable tool for any developer
looking to create state-of-the-art instruction models!

To make things even better, we are making this entire dataset free and
accessible to all who wish to use it. Check it out today at our HF org:

On top of that, we've trained very powerful models that you can try right now
