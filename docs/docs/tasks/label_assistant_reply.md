# Label Assistant Reply

Given the following discussion, provide labels for the final prompt. In addition
to the
[Prompting Guide](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/docs/guides/prompting),
here are specific advices on how to correctly label the reply:

- Response from the a assistant needs to have a higher of quality. Generally, we want
  the assistant's response to have any meaningful amount of content related to the
  topic, but do best judgement on whether to label the reply as spam or not.
- For "Is it a bad reply, as an answer to the prompt task?", a bad reply in this
  case is inappropriate, irrelevant or distracting from the conversation. Make
  sure to tick the reasons below the question as well.
- For the 1-to-5 scales below, don't think too much about the ratings itself. If
  you're unsure of any labeling criteria, feel free to leave it blank
