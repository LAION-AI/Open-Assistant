# Label Assistant Reply

Given the following discussion, provide labels for the final prompt. In addition
to the
[Prompting Guide](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/docs/guides/prompting),
here are specific advices on how to correctly label the reply:

- "Is the message spam?" is pretty self-explainatory.
- For "Is it a bad reply, as an answer to the prompt task?", a bad reply in this
  case is inappropriate, irrelevant or distracting from the conversation. Make
  sure to tick the reasons below the question as well.
- For the 1-to-5 scales below, don't think too much about the ratings itself. If
  you're unsure of any labeling criteria, feel free to leave it blank
