# Classifying an assistant reply

In this task, you'll be shown a random message written by another person. This
message is mimicing a reply from the assistant, adressing a previous prompt from
a user - an **assistant reply**. Your job is to rate parameters like quality or
politeness, as well as include any applicable labels, such as spam, PII or
sexual content.

If you can't determine whether or not a reply is factually accurate, skip it
instead. If you are unsure of the definition of any of the labels, look up their
definition
[here](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/docs/guides/guidelines#label-explanation).

Please make sure to read the
[guidelines](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/docs/guides/guidelines#classifying-assistant)
before submitting.
