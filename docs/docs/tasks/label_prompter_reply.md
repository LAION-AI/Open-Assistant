# Label Prompter Reply

Given the following discussion, provide labels for the final prompt. In addition
to the
[Prompting Guide](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/docs/guides/prompting),
here are specific advices on how to correctly label the prompt:

- If the prompt has any amount of content, no matter how low quality it is, it
  shouldn't be labeled as spam. As long as it is answerable by the assistant,
  the prompt is not spam.
- If the prompt is inappropriate, make sure to tick the reasons.
- For the 1-to-5 scales below, don't think too much about the ratings itself. If
  you're unsure of any labeling criteria, feel free to leave it blank.
