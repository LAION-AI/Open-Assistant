# Providing an initial prompt or user reply

In these tasks, you will play the role of a person interacting with the
chatbot - the **user**. If you are providing a user reply, you'll see a message
from the assistant that is already responding to the user you are imitating.
Your job is to create a message that provides the assistant a clear request or
question - a **prompt**. Try to give the assistant a variety of assignments that
might come up in daily use, and avoid violating any guidelines.

When providing a user reply, there will be at least one additional prompt prior
to yours. Keep in mind that the reply you're submitting is supposed to be coming
from the same user, so try asking follow-up question that might naturally arise.

Please make sure to read the
[guidelines](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/docs/guides/guidelines#user-reply)
before submitting.
