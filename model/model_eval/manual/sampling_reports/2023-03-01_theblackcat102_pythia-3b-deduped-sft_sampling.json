It appears in various experiments such as electron-electron scattering, cosmic rays or solar radiation studies. Because this quantity cannot be directly measured, we must rely on indirect measurements to calculate its value and compare results from different laboratories. The uncertainty involved when calculating the value is typically about 10%, though can vary depending on both experimental techniques used and other factors.

            "The value of the fundamental \"fine\" (smallest) scale in nature that describes quantum physics is known as the fine structure constant. It's one of the most important constants in science because it governs everything from hydrogen bonding and nuclear decay rates for elements like helium down to the magnetic field inside atoms which determines their electronic levels and chemical behavior. But its exact numerical value remains largely unknown: we know it has an approximate value of 1/137 based on theory but we can't predict what this actual value would be without more precise measurements beyond our current experimental tools. This lack of knowledge led some researchers to estimate a value anywhere between 10-18"

But more recently we've learned that the people who made contact with Roanoke weren't really looking for colonists like what is commonly accepted today - they were just trying to get rich quick.\n\nThis theory stems largely from several linguistic analysis which suggest that all modern English vocabulary derived from either Yuchi or Tuscarora languages and it's unclear how much of this came via African slaves brought directly from their homeland into Virginia/Carolina (probably a mixture). However if some groups arrived directly from Africa then others would have likely traveled far to reach them initially,"
