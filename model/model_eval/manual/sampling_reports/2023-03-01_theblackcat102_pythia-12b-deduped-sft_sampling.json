Additionally consider what types of investments are suited to different situations such as long term savings vs saving aggressively or taking more risk than necessary.

            "The novel explores many themes and ideas concerning time in many subtle ways. One is that it's essentially a character study focusing primarily on Jay Gatsby who embodies everything he has fought for including his desire, ambition and self-proclaimed success. However, throughout much of the narrative, we're shown events of long ago which create an overall sense of nostalgia as if remembering past times when Gatsby was young would allow us to understand him better and how this ultimately led up to the death of the girl he loved so dearly. At one point during the novel, Fitzgerald also tells readers what I think makes The Great Gats",
            "One aspect which is particularly important for understanding The Great Gatsby is how it captures the American Dream through symbolism. This can be seen throughout both Nick Carraway's and Jay Gatzmire's narration and their experiences with love and loss in relation to time. Through thematic elements such as setting, characters, imagery, language, and plot structure allusions to the themes of America\u2019s obsession with fame and fortune; how our identities are formed around these concepts rather than substance or virtue; and what happens when we lose sight of that dream. These ideas show us the dangers of living solely based off material wealth or ambition"

In American English, we call aircraft flying machines (planes) with wings and rotors helicopters because their movement makes them very similar to the rotorcrafts or helios used in aviation. However the term helicopter refers more than just any kind of rotorplane it's also commonly considered a machine or apparatus intended primarily for flight under artificial power using a rotating wing set above the propeller-driven main shaft (the engine) which gives rotary motion rather than forward motion - i.e the way planes do (a fixed wing). A helicopter therefore has multiple sets of such blades - one up front near the nose containing either three",
