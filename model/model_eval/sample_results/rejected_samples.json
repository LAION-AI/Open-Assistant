If retirement is important to you then make sure your chosen plan has high return options and good employer matching contributions so you'll be able to maximize returns in an effort to meet short term financial goals within reason. Additionally consider what types of investments are suited to different situations such as long term savings vs saving aggressively or taking more risk than necessary. Consider factors like fee structure before deciding which option offers the most value but also be mindful not to sacrifice quality because you want something affordable instead focusing on making sure everyone wins when it comes to this decision",
