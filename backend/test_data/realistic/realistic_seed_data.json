At the same time, if you wear something that looks kind of dorky, you might not stand out as much as someone who doesn\u2019t, because the other candidates probably all have something slightly weird or wacky about them too.  So, I\u2019d say, do you like your outfit?  Wear something that you\u2019re comfortable in, that you think you look good in, and is in line with what the job would require.

It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the notion that \u201cThey\u2019re in time out, and that\u2019s the end of it!\u201d but kids can be pretty imaginative, and they can use their own creativity to make their way out of time outs.  A compassionate time out ends when the child shows a sign of understanding what they\u2019ve done wrong, and are ready to begin again.  That way the child knows they\u2019re learning, and that the parent is seeing them as an intelligent person, even if they sometimes mess up.

Some research suggests that electricity could be used as an \u201cartificial stimulus\u201d, essentially mimicking the action of biological bone growth and bone formation.  This research is still in its early stages and requires further study, but could be especially interesting in the context of bone loss and treatment, in conjunction with potential new treatments for Osteoporosis.

The Puritans observed the Sabbath on Sunday, and the Puritans only had a small influence in the early history of the USA.  It\u2019s difficult to trace the origins of closing stores on Sunday, but one early and short-lived attempt at forcing the Sabbath on people in the 1800s was motivated by the Protestant ideal that people should spend Sunday focusing on spiritual activities.  By the mid-1800s, when the Sunday closing law was made, there was not a lot of pressure from that standpoint, but the church had begun to advocate for Sunday closing laws as a way of counteracting the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest.  Even after that shift, closing stores on Sunday was not always possible, since the religious Sunday was not always chosen for observance.  And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.  The day of rest was also being violated by stores that stayed open all day on Sunday, so closing stores on Sundays became an effort to protect the Sabbath for all citizens.",

Palatalization refers to a shift from a sound in the front of the mouth to a sound in the back of the mouth. These types of shifts are actually quite common, as a lot of languages change their sound systems over time. Take the English words for \u201cold\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d. In Old English (also called Anglo-Saxon, or sometimes \u201cOE\u201d), these were pronounced as [adl] and [kld]. In Middle English (or \u201cME\u201d), they were pronounced with a \u201cd\u201d that\u2019s like a \u201ct\u201d (like in the \u201ct\u201d in the word \u201ctoy\u201d), and [k]. But in Modern English, we now pronounce the \u201cd\u201d more like \u201ct\u201d, and the [k] has palatalized to a [t].

You\u2019ll also hear the same kind of shift in words like \u201cpick\u201d, \u201ckick\u201d, and \u201cblack\u201d when spoken. Can you imagine saying those three words? Which are pronounced with your front teeth and which are pronounced with your back teeth?",

But you can try [y] sounds, for example, like the \u201cy\u201d in \u201cyellow\u201d. For example, when I say \u201cyum\u201d (like in \u201cdelicious food!\u201d), I\u2019m pronouncing that word in a way that puts it closer to the \u201cju\u201d in \u201cjudicious\u201d. That\u2019s a velarization - we\u2019re palatalizing the /u/ in \u201cyum\u201d towards a /y/ sound. Velarization often happens in sound shifts, like the Great Vowel Shift, but it can also happen on its own, like when I say \u201cyum\u201d to be yummy.",

There\u2019s no single right solution, so I suggest finding a tool that helps you to discover your triggers.  \nYour brain has built-in ways of coping with problems, so I recommend checking out your automatic thought processes and using those to drive your behavior.  If you have trouble falling asleep, you might find that you're thinking about a problem that\u2019s still unsolved, and that these thoughts are causing anxiety.  If so, that means your automatic thought processes are encouraging you to focus on what you don\u2019t want.  I\u2019m not sure how familiar you are with behavioral approaches to thinking, but one example is to replace your thoughts about the problem with some kind of positive thought that takes your mind in a new direction.  For example, you might want to \u201creplace\u201d a thought like \u201cI can\u2019t sleep because there\u2019s a problem I haven\u2019t solved\u201d, with \u201cI\u2019ll work on that tomorrow\u201d.

There was not full-scale war between these groups and the country\u2019s remaining republic, Serbia, but there was fierce fighting and conflict between Serbs and Croatians in Croatia and Bosnia.  In March 1991, the leaders of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia agreed to establish a joint state called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  After Serbia\u2019s president Slobodan Milosevic threatened to create a Greater Serbia if Bosnia and Herzegovina would not agree to a centralized state, Croatia and Bosnia declared their independence in 1991.  A further agreement was made in 1992 that all the former republics would join a loose association of states known as the \u201cFederal Republic of Yugoslavia\u201d, and this was accepted in the U.N. as the successor state to Yugoslavia.  However, in 1993 the leaders of Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia again took power in Serbia, and broke the alliance with Bosnia.  A war began between Serbia and Bosnia, which killed thousands and led to the refugee crisis that lasted into the 21",

After a number of scandals in the public eye, many people were appalled by the state of alcohol abuse in the United States and favored the law in an attempt to curtail the negative impacts. The most influential of these scandals was the murder of a prominent industrialist named William Randolph Hearst by a would-be assassin. The assassin was a vagrant, who was convicted of the crime under extremely prejudicial conditions. The details of the case showed that the killer had a very serious and long-standing alcohol addiction. Public opinion at the time of the trial favored the idea that the killer was a killer-not a drunk, but an individual who did not do what he did through willpower and determination, but instead, due to the weakness and inability to control his alcohol consumption. In the aftermath of the trial, public opinion was very negatively polarized towards alcohol, and people were eager to pursue measures that would restrict or completely prohibit the sale of alcohol.

    "text": "Assistant: One way to think about it is this:  You can make a car without a human driver in two different ways.  The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter.  The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors.  When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it\u2019s like you are driving, but you aren\u2019t.  You\u2019d control the robot, and the robot would control the car.  If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn\u2019t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead.  This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up.",

    "text": "Assistant: The safety of autonomous cars is a very controversial topic right now.  As a car moves along a road, it\u2019s constantly receiving information from its sensors: can it see nearby traffic, or other road users?  And it\u2019s constantly receiving information from its GPS system: what is the speed limit in this location, where are the red lights?  And it\u2019s always making decisions: how fast should it go?  Does it have the right-of-way?  The driver is an important part of all of this decision-making, but it\u2019s one of the most challenging areas of technology.  Autonomous cars are often compared to flying an airplane, where you just get on and have your fun, and there\u2019s a crew in charge.  The computers do the hard work of flying.  But you can\u2019t just look at something and tell if it\u2019s safe to drive.  There\u2019s always a tradeoff.  For example, we can take a picture of an intersection and see how many cars have stopped there at different times, and then estimate how many cars are likely to arrive in the future.  But no image will ever be able to tell you exactly how many cars will be in an intersection at any given time, because each car is in motion, and each driver is different and can change his or her mind in the moment.  In the end, the computer is probably making hundreds of judgments, some of them simple, and some of them incredibly complicated.  And humans make judgments too.  That\u2019s why the driver needs to be paying attention, and must still be able to see clearly, and still must have his or her own ideas about what to do.",

In terms of cleaning, you can use an acid cleaning once per year if your water is high in calcium and you don\u2019t want to risk killing the filter bacteria. Otherwise, you should clean the walls, floors, and vinyl. As for pump maintenance, you should check the seals and the motor on a semi-annual basis.

German has fewer cases and fewer tenses and verb forms than French, so that can make German a little easier to learn.  Another big difference between French and German is the written language:  French uses the Latin alphabet and German uses the Gothic alphabet.  A small number of words have slightly different sounds in the two languages, but not many, and that may also make it easier to learn French.  For more languages you could start with German.

In this specific case, the dopamine system is a neurotransmitter that works to coordinate, process, and distribute signals of various types in the nervous system.  For a small part of that mechanism, there are two endogenous receptors for dopamine that work by binding to the neurotransmitter and transporting it elsewhere in the body.  Without these two receptors, dopamine is either bound to the cell membrane or transported to the synaptic space of other neurons, which also bind to and transport it away from the transmitter in their own way.  In the \u201cboost dopamine levels\u201d sense, one could just change the \u201cenvironment\u201d so that a greater number of these neurotransmitters are released, but this won\u2019t actually change the amount of the transmitter that is bound to the receptors.",

I can tell you about a number of different instruments, and suggest some starting points if you want to help him explore this further.  \nThe first instrument to start with could be a trumpet or French horn, if he's interested in the brass section.  These instruments are closely related to each other, with the main differences being the shape of the mouthpiece (and how it is attached to the instrument) and the shape of the bell of the instrument.  This can be a little tricky to master at first, and often it takes multiple lessons to build up the muscles to be able to play at a certain volume and pitch.  \nAnother instrument to try is the trombone. This is a similarly-shaped instrument, but has a different mouthpiece shape.  Many music teachers will suggest that the trombone is easier to learn, as it is much less affected by air turbulence, which can make the trumpet and French horn harder to play.  \nThere are also other instruments that are more advanced, but can be pretty good fun.  For instance, the euphonium is a brass instrument that is essentially the same as a trombone, but with a much larger and longer bell, which makes it slightly",

In this political environment, Nixon began the administration known as the \u201cGreat Silence\u201d, a period where he didn\u2019t talk about the issues facing the nation and didn\u2019t hold press conferences.  So while there was a strong opposition to his administration, there was no reliable record of what the Nixon administration actually believed and what actions it was taking.",

One of the burglars was arrested and revealed a number of links between himself and the White House, which involved a conspiracy to cover up evidence of the Watergate break-in.  As it turned out, the burglary was committed by Nixon\u2019s reelection committee, and evidence found in Nixon\u2019s own handwriting was discovered that related to the Watergate burglary.

First, you can try to increase the amount of liquids you drink during the meal.  For example, drinking water before, during, and after eating.  Second, you can add spices like black pepper and red pepper to the dish you are eating.  These spices can help reduce the discomfort of spicy foods.  Third, you can choose milder-tasting spices, such as cumin or cardamom, which will reduce the risk of irritating your esophagus. \nAnother way to reduce the impact of spicy foods on your body is to eat them in smaller amounts or spread them out over a longer time period.  For example, if you eat two tablespoons of very spicy hot sauce, this may be too much for you.  You can try eating one teaspoon of the hot sauce each day for a week.  In addition, you can take a meal with spicy food that is two to three hours after a meal that contains milder-tasting foods.  This will also reduce the likelihood that spicy foods will cause",

So it\u2019s great to use them in situations where these hazards are acceptable. This is commonly the case for flashlights. But if you\u2019re the consumer, you\u2019ll want to be sure that you\u2019re buying LiPo batteries from a manufacturer that actually tests its product for safety. Another thing to consider is that since the chemical reaction in LiPo batteries causes it to decompose to lithium metal, and a little of that metal can cause fires, you\u2019ll also want to take care not to discharge it down to a very low voltage or to handle it in conditions that would cause it to heat up a lot.",

Gender reassignment surgery involves one of two options either surgery to make the genitals look a certain way, or surgery to block or reverse the hormones that make the genitals look male. If you decide to go with the surgery to make your genitals look different, the \u201cnew\u201d genitals have to be made by taking skin from somewhere else on the body, and then surgically attaching it to the existing genitals. The surgery itself doesn\u2019t just change a penis into a vagina, it also changes a lot of other things about your body.

So it\u2019s hard to say what happens if it\u2019s a blind person who becomes blind later in life.  I think a person could find a way to be oriented about day and night, but the language and culture of blind people also helps them develop their sense of time in the day.

I can tell you that this is something you can do with a child as young as two.  Just like other behavior, your child learns it through repetition and practice.  You\u2019ll want to teach your child to use the potty, before you do anything else.  So, start by taking your child to the potty about once an hour, after eating, drinking, and napping.  It\u2019s important to be consistent with this.  Don\u2019t let your child hold it, as this can cause constipation and irritable bowels.  And while you\u2019re teaching your child, make sure you ask them if they\u2019re trying to pee or poop and when they\u2019re done.

But a good rule of thumb is if your child can walk and communicate, they should be able to be potty trained.  You can help the process by taking your child to the potty often.  Make sure they know what it\u2019s for.  Also, make sure you have some toilet paper on hand.  When they do use the potty, tell them they did a great job, as they may not feel it yet.

When you put water in a pot and bring it to a boil, these bubbles form on the surface, and eventually they become larger and they appear to jump up into the air.  However, once the water has boiled, you may have trouble seeing these bubbles.  This is because when water boils, you can boil off the water itself!  So these tiny bubbles, after boiling for a while, don\u2019t rise up into the air, and instead stay in the water.  So, to be sure that the water is boiling, you have to do something about these tiny bubbles, and I have the perfect idea!  I can suggest that we remove the pot from the heat for a few minutes, and then come back and look at the water.  If there are no bubbles on the surface, then I think you\u2019ll know that the water has finished boiling!",

But as the pot fills up, there are more particles in the water, so the temperature of the water in the pot increases faster than the temperature of the water you\u2019re observing.

You\u2019ll need to cut the peppers into little strips with your knife, and it\u2019s good to eat the seeds, too, they\u2019re tasty and add a lot of fiber to your diet.

It is helpful to clean silver jewelry without tarnishing if you have similar metals nearby.  A great way to avoid tarnishing is by using a small piece of crumpled up tissue paper that has a bit of salt, vinegar, or baking soda on it.  That should keep the tarnishing away.  You can even use hairspray in a pinch, but the effects might be temporary and the aluminum used in hairspray could cause other problems.  \nIt might be good to keep these items around in a little pouch of their own, in case you ever need to do some jewelry cleaning.",

Other research suggests that the drugs themselves, or the drugs\u2019 effects, or both, can keep prisoners from experiencing pain during the procedure.

As I\u2019ve explained in this dialogue, people have experienced pain, and some people may experience excruciating pain.

The first recorded legal execution by hanging was in 1612 in England, and the first recorded execution by firing squad was in 1823 in the US.  In the 1930s, scientists developed several methods of execution using gas and electricity, which are now the two most common methods of execution in the United States.  Many people have said that this technique is \u201chumane\u201d, but it\u2019s actually still pretty horrible.  Gas and electricity is a \u201clethal injection\u201d in a sense.

These are typically small aquatic turtles (small than a small dinner plate, up to 2 inches in length) with a black stripe on their heads, and there are even red-eared ones that are all-red.  If you are wanting to find turtles that are already small enough to keep in the house, you could also look for aquatic or mini tortoises.  There are also very small alligators, called baby alligators, that are suitable for a household pet.  I would generally recommend the turtles or alligators over a frog as pets, since they\u2019re more likely to be able to live with humans than a frog, and the tadpoles are still more liable to infection.",

It's very often based on someone being afraid to ask for what they need, in a form that is concrete enough for the other person to understand.  In other words, it's a way of making a relationship work because there are all sorts of hidden assumptions being made that are basically not expressed, which leads to mistrust, unhappiness, and in the worst cases conflict or breakups.  Here's an analogy:  You can feel very angry with someone because they are allowing you to do things that you don't really want to do for them, and it can make you feel worse about yourself.

We\u2019ll start by thinking of language that is important for her to learn and list it, then we\u2019ll figure out the situations where she might want to use it, and from there, I\u2019ll help her learn the vocabulary!

If you\u2019re asking about age lines, which are not technically wrinkles but tend to occur at similar places to wrinkles, the first method is still effective and some scientific evidence suggests that ointments are effective in reducing these lines, while injections are most effective in preventing their formation.",

The ribs are connected to the breastbone (sternum) and to the spine (thoracic vertebrae).  In between each pair of ribs are spaces for the lungs to move.  Ribs are separated by two thin membranes called the pleura.  In the center of each side of the rib cage is the heart, which is enclosed by the sternum, breastbone, and spine.  The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle that sits just above the lungs, and separates the thoracic cavity (the space between the lungs and the abdomen) from the abdominal cavity (the space between the abdomen and the chest).  The diaphragm is used to allow breathing, but it also helps regulate the pressure of the abdomen, and thus blood flow, to help the heart function more efficiently.",

The rest of the thorax is separated into the central tendon, the sternum, the rib cage, the posterior ribs, the intercostal muscles, the internal thoracic artery, the internal thoracic vein, and the esophagus.  The intercostal muscles are intercostal muscles.  They help to maintain the integrity of the rib cage and provide rigidity to the chest wall.  The internal thoracic artery and the internal thoracic vein both transport blood from the right ventricle to the intercostal muscles.  The esophagus connects the pharynx to the stomach.",

You can put a big sign outside your house, to advertise the sale, but also on the door, to let people know that you\u2019re accepting bids.

In the video, Robinson uses a theme from the poem \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d by Robert Frost as a conceptual jumping off point.  \nSo imagine the future society, where Robinson\u2019s line of thinking has gained currency, and children are encouraged to make some real changes in their learning.

If people don\u2019t feel that what they\u2019re doing is meaningful, then they won\u2019t see the value in the activities that help them do those things.  You could be a person who puts all your value in material things, and you\u2019ll want to have as many of them as possible, because you don\u2019t know what else there is to do with your life.  Or you could have a sense that you are doing something that has an impact on the world, like solving a social problem, or raising a child, or painting a beautiful picture, and you\u2019ll have less need for material goods, because you have these other things that give you meaning.  And in turn, it might make you very attached to some of your possessions, or certain possessions, because you really value what they give you.  I think this might be true at the individual level, but it might also be true at the societal level.

It is about a stranger who arrives in a small town, and begins to interfere in a love triangle between the town\u2019s prostitute, her psychopath husband, and her new boyfriend. The strangers name is \u201cHarmonica\u201d, played by Charles Bronson. The film is unique in that it has no real main character or hero. Harmonica is just a mysterious drifter who arrives in the town, and throughout the film attempts to intervene in the plot between the town\u2019s women and the psychopathic villain. In the end Harmonica is wounded by the villain and left to die in the desert.",

The second step is to prepare two cupcake pans by lining them with paper liners and greasing them with butter.  This is because paper liners help prevent the cupcake batter from sticking to the pan.  Then you prepare your cupcake batter by combining 4 eggs, 2 cups of sugar, 4 1/4 cups flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 cup of butter.  After that, you can take the cupcake batter and add it to the cupcake pan, and bake it for about 20 minutes, until the cupcake is done.  Then, to make icing, you mix 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of milk, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.  This gives you 1/4 cup of icing, which you can then use to frost the cupcake.  To make 1/4 cup of icing, you can mix 1 cup of sugar, 3/4 cup of butter, 1 egg, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.  This gives you more icing, which you can use to decorate the cupcake.  Voila!

So we\u2019ll use the smaller pans, and we\u2019ll divide the batter between them, one pan will be twice the size of the other.  We want to add at least two extra spoonfuls of batter to the smaller pan, as the amount you add to a pan is going to expand while baking and soak up the liquids you put in it.  So let\u2019s start with 6 eggs, 4 cups of flour, 3/4 cup of milk, and 1/2 cup of sugar.  One of these eggs is really big, and the others are smaller.  We\u2019ll put them in a separate mixing bowl, then we\u2019ll use the beater to break them up, and we\u2019ll combine the flour and milk to make a paste.  Now, you\u2019ll notice that the larger egg will be the one making this much bigger than the others.  We want to mix the eggs into the dry mixture and also the milk and sugar, and then we want to add a tablespoon of vanilla.  The vanilla is important, it\u2019s really what makes the cake taste so good!  Now we want to stir everything together, and it\u2019s important to be patient and use a whisk.  Once the eggs are all mixed together we\u2019ll add the wet ingredients.  Now, we want to mix everything really well to make sure it\u2019s all mixed evenly.  We\u2019ll mix for a full three minutes, we\u2019ll let the mixer run at high speed for two minutes, and then we\u2019ll run it at medium speed for one minute.  Then we\u2019ll stop the mixer, take the whisk out, and take the bowl of batter off the mixer.  Next, we\u2019ll use the same whisk to beat the batter in the bowl, so that the air bubbles go away and it\u2019s completely mixed.  We don\u2019t want any clumps.  Once the bubbles have been beaten away, we\u2019ll pour in the batter into two smaller pans.  In the larger pan, we\u2019ll pour in three cups of batter, and in the smaller pan we\u2019ll pour in two cups.  We want to fill the smaller pan to the very brim, and even pour over some extra batter if we have it.  And we\u2019ll do the same for the",

It's not as intense as a barbell press, but the higher range of motion provides a lot of stimulation for the triceps. You should also be in the best position for triceps growth. You'll stand with your hands resting on a bench, or a squat rack. Then you'll straighten your arms until they're extended, and let your hips dip down towards the floor. A common mistake people make is to let their hips travel too far forward. It's not advisable to let the hips come all the way down, as this can impact the backs of the legs. You might also feel a sensation of \"burn\" in your shoulder, but this is a sign that you are doing the exercise correctly.

So maybe you could start by listing all the past rejections you remember, and going through them with me.  We could go through them and think about what caused each rejection, and see if we can think of any patterns.

You might be angry at your dog for getting into a fight with a neighborhood cat, and so on.  Often grief can be seen as a mixture of many other emotions, but in the main it is often experienced as a more negative state of mind than sadness.

Another type of grief, called ordinary grief, is the most common type of grief, and typically involves someone who loses a close friend or family member.  This type of grief is experienced by many people, but it can also be less complicated than other types of grief, since it usually involves a sense of loss, and just the standard feelings of sadness, anger, and helplessness that are usually involved with loss.

However, there are several factors you can look at to try to determine which type of grief you have.  First, if you feel very sad or depressed after a loss, that\u2019s generally a sign that you\u2019re feeling grief.  The important thing is to be careful not to let those feelings of depression and sadness prevent you from doing the things you need to do in order to feel better, such as reaching out to friends and family members, and following a healthy eating and sleeping routine.  Another sign that you\u2019re experiencing grief is that you might feel angry at people or things that have nothing to do with your loss.  If you\u2019re angry, or feel that you\u2019re being mistreated, it\u2019s a sign that you are experiencing grief.  Again, though, this feeling is common and doesn\u2019t always mean that you are experiencing grief.  If you feel both sad and angry, but you also feel worried and depressed, that\u2019s usually a sign that you are experiencing complicated grief.",

These include reading food labels to figure out if your grocery store has the best prices on an item, watching sales, buying bulk and trying out whole foods.  Let\u2019s say you have a brand of cookies that you like to eat.  Maybe you could try reading some of the labels on your favorite brand of cookies to see how the ingredients differ.  You can also find out if you have a favorite brand that has better deals during sales.  For example, Costco has weekly sales that can be very good for saving money on groceries.  Another thing you could do is to pick your favorite type of food, like canned fruits or canned vegetables, and then look to see if your grocery store has the best price on those items.  Another strategy is to look into other stores like Trader Joe\u2019s and Whole Foods, which have higher quality foods and may have better prices.",

Avoid walking through smoke or thick dust, and avoid open flames, so as to not ignite clothing or hair. For safety, wear protective equipment like masks, and wet/layered clothing. For re-entry to the house, stay on the perimeter of the scene, and avoid touching any fire or smoke. If the fire is not under control, leave the scene, and notify emergency services (911, in the US) as quickly as possible. If an extinguisher is available, do not throw water onto the fire. Instead, douse it in an area where it can\u2019t spread, or use a foam extinguisher to smother the fire. Otherwise, extinguishers should be held with both hands, and aimed at the base of the fire.

Start by using half as much chili powder in a regular dish of whatever you are eating.  If it is spicy enough for you, then next time use less than half the amount, and repeat this process until you are eating as much chili powder as you\u2019d like.

It\u2019s easier to use a double boiler, which you can put on the stove and heat water in, but it\u2019s also okay if you just use a small pan.  First you\u2019ll need to heat the water in a pan over a stove or fire, but not enough that it will start boiling.  Once the water starts boiling, slowly add the wax into the water.  As soon as the wax is in the water, you want to stir it to create a thicker layer of wax, so it doesn\u2019t dissolve into the water, but a little bit will melt.  That\u2019s important to avoid wax in the bottom of your candles and extra wax in your fingers.  When the wax has melted, you should notice that the water is getting cloudy, and that means it is saturated with wax and it\u2019s safe to add the wick.",

You've told me you drive about 100 miles, and we'll assume you're using an average sized car, which gets around 22 miles per gallon.  That's 22.6 litres per 100 miles.  The cost per litre of gasoline is about 15 dollars per litre.  So the cost to drive 100 miles is $225.   There are several ways to get from where you live to where you work.

More importantly, this argument is immoral since it requires punishing people who have not committed any crime, which is by definition immoral.  Moreover, if we were to ban guns outright, gun crime would still exist.  For example, since there are numerous ways to circumvent anti-gun laws, criminals would just use other weapons (e.g. knives, clubs, and bombs) in place of guns.  Furthermore, since anti-gun laws simply won\u2019t stop criminals from having guns, and won\u2019t stop most crimes, it seems reasonable to assume that they will actually increase the crime rate, since criminals will have even fewer constraints in committing their crimes.

The painter Vincent Van Gogh was an important artist in the late 1800s, who focused on what we call \u201cExpressionist\u201d art.  He believed that the artist should reflect their feelings in their art, rather than trying to describe them.  That means that there will often be very high emotion or intensity in his paintings.  And an interesting result of this is that some people don\u2019t really like Van Gogh\u2019s paintings.  For instance, when you Google his painting The Starry Night, you\u2019ll see lots of people sharing photos of it on social media saying things like \u201cI hate this painting\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s gross.\u201d  Other people find the high emotion of the painting intriguing or refreshing, and enjoy it.  So when thinking about a Van Gogh painting, keep in mind that he might have painted something you find exciting, but other people might find it upsetting.  For instance, let\u2019s say you found the painting Starry Night exciting.  Some of the other paintings I\u2019ll mention could be similar to Starry Night, so be prepared to see some pretty intense artworks.",

In this saying, people promise they won\u2019t break promises, which will lead to them breaking their promises and keeping the saying.
