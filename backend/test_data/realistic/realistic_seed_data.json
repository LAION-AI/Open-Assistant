Which means that you need to try to make yourself sound as good a fit as possible.  So that means it\u2019s a mistake to wear something that people would think of as a silly or stupid outfit.  It\u2019s good to wear something in line with what people expect the job to require, and ideally you want to wear something that you can walk around comfortably in.  At the same time, if you wear something that looks kind of dorky, you might not stand out as much as someone who doesn\u2019t, because the other candidates probably all have something slightly weird or wacky about them too.  So, I\u2019d say, do you like your outfit?  Wear something that you\u2019re comfortable in, that you think you look good in, and is in line with what the job would require.  Also, for interview prep, I would focus on making yourself look as professional as possible, from your hair to your outfit.  What do you think of this?",

It\u2019s difficult to trace the origins of closing stores on Sunday, but one early and short-lived attempt at forcing the Sabbath on people in the 1800s was motivated by the Protestant ideal that people should spend Sunday focusing on spiritual activities.  By the mid-1800s, when the Sunday closing law was made, there was not a lot of pressure from that standpoint, but the church had begun to advocate for Sunday closing laws as a way of counteracting the negative effects of industrialization on the day of rest.  Even after that shift, closing stores on Sunday was not always possible, since the religious Sunday was not always chosen for observance.  And as industrialization accelerated and mechanization made it possible to operate stores on Sunday, the law was not enforced as much as people liked.  The day of rest was also being violated by stores that stayed open all day on Sunday, so closing stores on Sundays became an effort to protect the Sabbath for all citizens.",

Velarization refers to a shift from a sound in the back of the mouth to a sound in the front. Palatalization refers to a shift from a sound in the front of the mouth to a sound in the back of the mouth. These types of shifts are actually quite common, as a lot of languages change their sound systems over time. Take the English words for \u201cold\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d. In Old English (also called Anglo-Saxon, or sometimes \u201cOE\u201d), these were pronounced as [adl] and [kld]. In Middle English (or \u201cME\u201d), they were pronounced with a \u201cd\u201d that\u2019s like a \u201ct\u201d (like in the \u201ct\u201d in the word \u201ctoy\u201d), and [k]. But in Modern English, we now pronounce the \u201cd\u201d more like \u201ct\u201d, and the [k] has palatalized to a [t].
