#   are hence, unrelated.

# These lists are non-exhaustive, and are just used to generate candidate

# Each inference problem is a 6-tuple consisting of:
# - premises
# - inferences: [clause, reasoning chain]. Where reasoning chains is
#               a ("premises, inferences, name") list where premises is a subset
#               of original premises + inferences already obtained.
# - contradictions: same as above, with the last step being the contradiction.
# - unrelated: just a plain list of clauses.
# - propositions: list of all atomic clauses appearning in all the lists before.
# - contains_contradiction: whether the premises lead to a contradiction or not.
