# This file loops through compressed json tweet data, pre-processes them,
# and then extracts them into more unified parquet files that can be handed
# off for further processing. The main focus is on producing viable replies.

# Initial data exploration seems that there is no guarantee that the original
# tweets are in the archive, so we might need to extract suitable replies
# then get the original tweets separately, and then combine them into a
# suitable thread format that can be used by our instruction model.

# This assumes data downloaded from https://archive.org/details/twitterstream
# and that the internal .tar files are extracted locally.
# They are large files so using something like 7Zip or WinRar might be easier
# than putting all of it in scripts, but it is a possibility.

# I often work in notebooks. If you encounter any issue, please reach out to let me know.
