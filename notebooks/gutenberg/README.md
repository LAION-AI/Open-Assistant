# Dataset Card for "gutenberg_hu"

# Dataset Card for Project Gutenberg - Hungarian eBooks

## Dataset Description

- **Repository:**
  [Code](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant/openassistant/datasets/gutenberg/)

## Source data

Please **READ** the site's TOS before running the crawler Notebook and follow
these instructions:

- The website will IP ban crawlers for going through each book's metadata page
  separately. Instead use `catalog()` to access the list of available E-books.
  For more information, visit: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/feeds.html
- You can avoid running the crawler by mirroring the entire database of Project
  Gutenberg or use one of their FTPs instead, and then call the `parse()`
  function on each text
- For more on robot access see:
  https://www.gutenberg.org/policy/robot_access.html

How does it work?

- The crawler downloads the raw HTML code for each E-book based on **Text#** id
  (if available)
- The metadata and the body of text are not clearly separated so the parser will
  try to split them, then remove transcriber's notes and e-book related
  information from the body of text (text marked as copyrighted or malformed
  will be skipped)
- If there is text both the metadata and the cleared body of text are saved, the
  latter is then added to a filtered parquet file (will contain only the catalog
  information and body of text for the books that were successfully retrieved)

Copyright notice:

- Some of the books are copyrighted! The crawler (parser) will ignore all books
  with an english copyright header by utilizing a regex expression, but make
  sure to check out the metadata for each book manually to ensure they are okay
  to use in your country! More information on copyright:
  https://www.gutenberg.org/help/copyright.html and
  https://www.gutenberg.org/policy/permission.html
- Project Gutenberg has the following requests when using books without
  metadata: _Books obtianed from the Project Gutenberg site should have the
  following legal note next to them: "This eBook is for the use of anyone
  anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and
  with almost" no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or
  re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the United
  States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located
  before using this eBook."_
