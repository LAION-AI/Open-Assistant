# Notebooks

This is a folder with some useful notebooks, all the notebooks have a markdown
file with the same name (or a README.md if its a single notebook folder)
explaining what they do.

## Contributing

Contributing to notebooks and making new notebooks is very welcome. If you do
so, make sure to make a markdown (.md) file to go with your notebook, it makes
it easier for people to know what your notebook is about.

Check out the [example notebook](example/) for a reference example you can use
as a starting point.
