# CodeT Datasets

This folder contains two notebooks.

One will download the data used for Microsoft CodeT for tuning a model for
Python code generation from function docstrings, augment the data into prompt
and solution pairs and write them to `.jsonl` files.

The other will download the data used for Microsoft CodeT for tuning a model for
Python test generation from corresponding function docstrings, augment the data
into prompt and solution pairs and write them to `.jsonl` files.

## Requirements

Both notebooks require the library `requests`.
