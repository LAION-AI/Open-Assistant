In fact, I believe Iran having nuclear weapons makes the world less safe overall. However, I believe that as a sovereign nation they have the right to develop nuclear weapons if they so choose.\\n\\nWhy do I believe this:\\n\\n1. It is in Iran's best strategic interests to develop nuclear weapons in order to counter Israel (which has nuclear weapons), and additionally to one-up Saudi Arabia (their main regional rival), and guarantee their safety against other Arab nations with whom they have historically had rocky relations (Iraq, for example).\\n2. If Israel can illegally possess nuclear weapons (they haven't officially acknowledge they have nuclear weapons, nor have they signed the UN's non-proliferation treaty, making the weapons they do possess illegal), why can't Iran possess nuclear weapons, other than Western bias? Pakistan has nuclear weapons, and they are officially an Islamic Republic, and they can have nuclear weapons, even though their nuclear weapons are probably much more of a global security risk. \\n\\n3. Iran has proven itself to be a pragmatic and rational actor in world affairs. There is no reason to suspect that they would actually use a nuclear weapon, nor sell it to a terrorist group who would. They mainly want a nuclear weapon to secure their military position in the region, stick it to their rivals, and as a point of national pride. Because the West says Iran can't have a nuclear weapon, they want one all the more, and won't back down on that because of national pride, something an American should be able to sympathize with. \\n\\nNow, I recognize that Iran should not have nuclear weapons because it would cause an arms race in the most volatile region on Earth, but that doesn't mean that they, as a sovereign nation, do not have the right to develop a nuclear weapon. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

      "\t\t>>\t You are also assuming there will ever be a \"post scarcity\" period...  There is very little data supporting the idea that automation = less job opportunity overall.  There is some data that automation advances in a a given industry can reduce job opportunities in that industry for a period however there are very few instances where this is not made up for in scale. I.E. higher automation leads to growth in the industry which then leads to it hiring more people again, despite needing less people per unit produced. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Two things: A post scarcity economy is not defined by the absence of jobs, but by the lack of economic need for them.   Secondly, the automation I am referring to does not have a historical precedence. This is not about replacing a weak human welder with a untiring robot, this is about replacing the slow human brain with an efficient and specialized ai. In many fields human intelligence would be akin to outdated technology. Think of how horses were replaced by the superior automobile. Very few horses still work today, because they are only viable in verry narrow circumstances. The same will occur for humans, and like the horses, there is no real reason we will find new work just because we lost our economic value.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Is post-scarcity even possible? How much of the earth would we constantly need to be consuming to upkeep that kind of tech? It wouldn't come from nowhere right?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t No the automation you are talking about has many historical precedents.  Machines replace humans when they become better or more efficient at a job then a human could be.  You are merely talking about a state when there are no jobs left that are better done by a human.  However I am saying that this will never happen because throughout history when machines have taken over for what we are doing, this merely causes us to come up with something new to do. After some time we come up with a way to replace this new activity with a machine and so on and so forth. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Think about replicators from star trek. Assuming, for a moment, that they are possible,  they would fundamentally alter the entire economy. I assume they would effectively take waste and trash, break them down into atomic or sub atomic components and rebuild them into whatever someone wanted.   Resources become a lot less finite at that point.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t No, resources would still be consumed, just we would theoretically be so efficient a finite amount of resources is not a problem. I mostly used the term post scarcity because op used it, but in reality the \"utopia\" to be expected in the short term from automation is just a form a socialism, so nothing to be excited about, unless you really hate working.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Why? Economic value can not be forced onto a tool. When we have the technology that makes any possible task currently done by a human more cost effective, why would there be any need to hire humans? What can a human do that ais can not do better? Theoretically, nothing. In reality there are some functions that will take longer to automate than others, but time will eventually see all human labor as economically antiquated.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Because humans have an innate drive to do stuff. Horses never did, horses did what they were told to do, we dont, we do what we feel like doing. It used to be that everyone was a farmer, than technology progressed, now almost no one is farmer. Now we do other stuff, we do stuff that people in the 1500s would have though impossible or absurd.  So its probably safe to say that 500 years from now people will be doing stuff that we now think is impossible and absurd.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t A drive is not enough if there is no possible oppertunity for it to succeed. I dont think you understand what I mean by automation. All humans do as workers is use their intelligence or strength to achieve goals. The human brain is akin to an organic computer, and we can design ones that are superior to it. The human muscle is nothing compared to machines, so all manual labor is also becoming unproductive. What does that leave for humans? Nothing large enough to employ the global workforce, or any significant proportion of it.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That is what someone in the 1500s would have said if you told them that in the future no one would ever have to farm again.  \"What else is there to do?\"   and then you would say  \"Well you can make huge contraptions made out of the black stuff that fire makes that fly through the air at 100x the speed of the fastest bird.\"  And they would tell you to go get your head checked.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Because no limit of human usefulness was conceivable 400 years ago does not mean that limit does not exist. If someone from 2400 told me of the things they were doing I imagine it would be equally astounding, but I doubt these tasks would be being done by humans.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t See this is where I lose you.  \"Human Usefulness\" is irrelevant, we don't need smart phones, we don't need airplanes, we don't need luxury watches or fancy suits or any of it. There are millions of things that exist and are beloved that serve no use in terms of base survival (reddit for example). But we do them because we enjoy it, I can create a machine that plays golf better than I play golf, but then I wouldn't get to play golf.  We could create machines that argue about pointless shit on Reddit better than you or me, but then we wouldn't get to do that either and that's no fun.

However, Iran insists both on developing nukes *and* remaining an NPT signatory non-nuclear state, and that's what makes their program illegal.

But if you, for example, participate in a mission trip to convert people to your religion - then I absolutely think you ought to be judged.

I might hate the color pink, but I wouldn't say that to someone wearing pink, because they'd be offended.  But I can hate the color and think it is ugly without hating the person wearing it.  I definitely hate organized religions that teach false things.  It doesn't mean I hate the practitioners of it, because they may be confused, or duped, or just following what they grew up with, or any number of reasons.  Likewise, I am not particularly offended if people hate MY religion.  Even though it is, of course, true, they don't KNOW that it is... why wouldn't they hate what they (wrongly, of course) believe to be false and therefore harmful?  But neither they nor I need to be dicks about it.  I don't go up to people and say \"I hate your religion\" because they would be offended.  They would take it personally because they identify so strongly with their religion that an attack on one they perceive as an attack on them.  And maybe it IS an attack on them... but the view was that one could do so without hate.  I can definitely attack a person's beliefs without hating that person.  I think Islam is a false, destructive religion.  I bear no hatred towards muslims.  They probably wouldn't *believe* me when I say that, but that's up to them.  I wouldn't tell a muslim I met \"I think your religion is all lies and people are going to suffer in hell for following that false prophet Muhammed.\"  They would be upset, and that is a predictable thing.  But hating the religion doesn't mean I hate the person.  Maybe I even hate some of their opinions or thought processes.  But that still doesn't mean I hate the person.  I could even love them, in the sense of wanting the best for them.  (But the best would likely include learning the truth.)\n",

Funny, this is how religious people think because in their eyes they are objectively right because \"God\" or whatever has the final say in what goes on and is their basis for morals instead of common sense/logic. (Which was in short supply when those religions were created in the first place) These days we know murder, rape, paedophilia, etc. is unanimously wrong.    The reason why it's so hard to talk/debate with some religious people is because they think they're in the right because of what some human wrote down in lieu of \"God\". Some of them don't want to change while others conform to humanist/secular thinking of the modern world. (Moderate/liberal religious people)   I think instead of hating people/ideas and having black and white thinking they should treat each situation as it comes because morality is totally subjective. As I said earlier, what we might see as wrong, murder, etc. other's might see as an excuse to express their religion, birthright, opinion, etc. in the form of whatever they might please.

That's kind of like talking about the concept of mutually assured destruction with respect to nuclear weapons by only talking about the impact of a missile hitting a city.  The point of a MAD scenario is that the threat of retaliation is so strong that you are deterred from acting in the first place.  For the extreme case, if literally everyone was carrying a gun, and everyone else knew this, it isn't unreasonable to propose that people would feel less confident trying to pull off an armed robbery or a shooting in the first place, and so the situation would be avoided entirely.

It might work in some small towns, but most places aren't going to have the same results.  They actually seem to be proving that since their crime rate is now increasing as their population goes up, though there could be other factors as well.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Depends on what goes down.  If there's some Jason Bourne type in the crowd who just pulls and puts the guy down right away I'd be thrilled.  But I think that it's more likely that someone who isn't prepared to deal with the stress and chaos of the situation will probably do more harm than good.  And the more people in the crowd all acting on their own, with no knowledge of which other shooters they should be shooting and and which ones they should be helping, the worse the situation is going to become.    I think that scenario is more likely, especially if we start encouraging a social norm that as many people as possible should be prepared to open fire at a moments notice.  So I'll play the odds and say that we should avoid a culture with that expectation.  There may be a few shootings that go on longer than they would have in OPs proposed world, but overall there will be far fewer deaths if we don't go that way.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That is far, *far* easier said than done.  If you aren't looking at the shooter when the shooter opens fire, then the average civilian has very little chance of correctly responding to this situation instinctively.  A lot(I would guess a majority) of people are going to perceive anyone shooting in their direction at all as a threat.  Say the shooter enters at one end of the room and someone at the other end returns fire.  How are all of the people in between to know that the second guy is trying to hit the criminal and not them?  I know you said that you think these people should be trained, but how much training do you think is reasonable to expect before we give them a gun, especially if we want to get such a huge number of people armed?  To be able to respond in a situation like that requires constant training and practice, and it's not realistic to expect so many people to do that when they aren't police or military.  It's just not realistic to expect a full fifth of our population to be able to react like SWAT team members at the drop of a hat.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t What you are asking for amounts to a trained police force, yet you went out of your way to say you don't want to arm the police force exclusively for fear of a police state. How would this be any different? These people with guns would still be the ones calling the shots (literally). Whether or not they correctly identify the right shooter (which is incredibly hard even with training, much less without), they will still be shooting to kill people. This will only increase the deaths in each mass shooting since more people will be doing the shooting. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t In any emergency situation, the only thing more gunfire, no matter how well intentioned, will do, is add to the confusion and increase the victims. I know if I were a terrorist looking to shoot as many innocent people as I could, I would love for someone to return fire at me - having 20% of the crowd begin firing at each other in the confusion would be a wet dream. They'd probably end up killing more people than any single terrorist, no matter how well-armed, could hope to do.  I'm pretty certain that if you went to any professional gun convention or NRA meeting, and began shooting at people, everyone with a brain would simply take cover and wait for the cops to come. Because they know guns and they know the *worst* thing to do in that situation would be to use them.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t It certainly is, but the OP was proposing that mass shootings could be mitigated by having a large number of citizens who are prepared to return fire, which is(in my estimation) simply not the case.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I really liked your explanation, and OP's non-answer was pretty hilarious. It sounded like a politician dodging a question.   I always have a similar sort of critique to anyone arguing for guns as a personal safety/protection tool. Guns escalate situations, and make people more unpredictable. It sounds so silly to me when people suggest they would be increase their safety by winning some sort of James Bond gun-fight over an imaginary foe.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I think it should be something of a level of the police training. Completing it should have benefits maybe even outside of the social stature.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t It would be different because the people with the guns wouldn't live among the policemen day by day on their paycheck, in short they wouldn't be policemen and share (most of) their problems and incentives.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well that is my point that the negatives you are envisioning wouldn't happen often enough to outweigh the benefits, as the people allowed to have the guns would understand this and wouldn't be just a common Joe who decided to get a gun on his way home from work.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Guns only escalate a situation *if they're brought into it*.  There seems to be a common misconception that those of us that carry actually WANT to use deadly force.  People seem to think that we'll pull at the drop of a hat.  While there are undoubtedly a few a-holes among us that do, the *VAST* majority simply do not think that way.  In point of fact, *most* people who carry understand the weight of the tool at their disposal.  We understand that if we believe the situation warrants use of a gun then we've decided this is a life-or-death situation.  Thankfully, most average citizens, gun carriers or not, never encounter such situations.  Speaking for myself, I only have once in my life and it was more than 25 years now... and, I managed to survive it without a gun.  But when you do, the alternatives are facing it with a tool that we all know is effective at it's job, or going at it without that tool.  Even though I survived my one such case without a gun I wouldn't want to make the gamble a second time.  No, the truth is that most people who carry understand that carrying a gun makes you the pussy in the room.  It makes you the person that backs down from any and all confrontations long before they escalate to the point of needing a gun.  They understand that they are the ones that take the insults and just walk away.  We keep our anger in check at all times.  We're also the ones that are paying attention to our surroundings at all times, not burying our faces in our phones and whatnot, because we understand that situational awareness is the key to staying alive whether you have a gun or not.  We notice the little details.  We move to the other side of the street if we think we see trouble coming (whether it \"looks bad\" or not).  We're the ones that, more importantly, won't even *BE* on that street in the first place.  Like I said, I'm sure you can find examples of people who carry who do so with the wrong mindset.  But if you spend any time around people who do carry you'll quickly realize those people are few and far between.  We're perfectly normal people, just like you, who just so happen to not want to be in a situation where we can't defend our lives.  Simple as that.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Yeah, police officers that I've talked to have told me that if shit like this goes down civilians should run.  If they can't run, they should hide.  Only when options one and two are out of the question does engaging become your best bet, and even then it's only because option four is get shot.  They also said that if option one or two ever present themselves again, take them and get out of dodge, and let the police do their job when they get there.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Except police training isn't like riding a bike.  You don't just lean it once and then you're good for life.  Being prepared for an active shooter scenario is gonna need constant practice, both mental and physical.  Most police officers wouldn't even be prepared for these kind of situations, which is why we have SWAT teams that specialize in those kind of scenarios(I'd also like to point out that if we wanted to train millions of people to SWAT levels of proficiency it would be comically expensive and I have no idea who would pay for it).  Add in the fact that the situation would likely be even more stressful than the average SWAT raid since the civilians have no knowledge of any of the other participants and were completely unprepared in the moment, and do you still feel that training which would necessarily be brief and infrequent enough to allow for these people to have other jobs would be extensive enough to mitigate dangers I brought up?  Because I just don't see that happening.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I say that they would share more incentive to abuse their power. They aren't policemen, they have no job description forbidding them from abusing their power wielded with the guns. Just because you wouldn't does not guarantee these people would make the same choice as you\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well I don't think this it is required to be SWAT-level trained, it isn't hard to teach people if not sure just stay on the safe side and don't pull out the gun and shoot. It should be standard to pull out gun only when you are going to shoot, so if someone aims at you you know his intentions and everyone would know this so they won't be stupid and aiming at random people.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well there already are a bunch of people who legally carry guns, aren't cops and there haven't been any significant number of reports of them abusing their power, while there have been lot of reports of cops abusing their power and criminals carrying guns.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Do you have any evidence to back up that assertion?  Because I've seen videos of people who just went through gun safety and combat training accidentally shoot themselves and each other with their paintball pistols when an ambush was simulated immediately after being told their course was over(can't remember where the videos were, I'll add them if I can find them later).  You seem to be handwaving how easy it would be to train people to go against their survival instincts and maintain a detached situation awareness in the face of death.  It takes months of training for both police and military before they are ready for active duty, and then they have constant ongoing training and evaluation to stay sharp.  Why would it be easier to train more civilians in less time?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t But the difference is that right now the people carrying the guns are not expected to uphold the peace. They have no power to abuse at the moment, but give it to them and they will abuse it, that is human nature\n",
      "\t\t>>\t You need to consider that in shootings maybe even the death counts per shooting would be same or maybe even a bit higher, but if it decreased the number of shootings so that the total death count from shootings would decrease it would be a success - the role as a detractor is important.  It would be easier to train civilians because their role is fundamentally different from the police. They would be only in role of defenders, not chasing down criminals or anything police and SWAT do. They perhaps would rarely be able to stop the first deaths of a mass shooting, but should be more effecting in stopping subsequent deaths.\n",

Why haven't more guns in USA equaled fewer mass shootings?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t You are assuming that spree shooters are going to rationally decide not to commit their crimes because they fear that they might be killed.  This is flawed logic.  Spree shooters are essentially always either killed or captured immediately following their crime in the culture that already exists.  Spree shooters know this before they do anything, and will often leave manifestos behind in anticipation of this.  Spree shooters either are irrational actors who believe themselves to be invincible or the exception, or they intend to die and want to take as many people as they can with them.  There have been many shootings in gun free areas, but there is no indication that the shooters would have just decided that they didn't want to commit mass murder because the chances of their survival or escape(which are minimal already) are lowered.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t What you're saying makes sense, but there's something I don't understand about your hypothetical. The bacon sandwich is presumably a metaphor for a printed image of Muhammad. This would mean that someone, somewhere printed such an image publicly that caused the Muslim extremists to react. If this was done benevolently, such as for education or out of ignorance or anything other than satire or malice, then I emphatically agree that the artists at Charlie Hebdo were to be lauded for their fight against censorship. But I feel this may be being overly reductive, so would you mind shedding a little more light onto the origin of this first bacon sandwich?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t The first bacon sandwich came about because 90% of the world (made up statistic) has no problem eating bacon, just like there's a sizable percentage of the world that isn't offended by images of Muhammed and isn't prohibited by any law (religious or civil) that says they can't draw them.  So they did.  They made that bacon sandwich.  In the real world, Jews see people eating bacon sandwiches all the time and don't care.  They're not going to do it themselves because their faith forbids it, but they're also not going to try to tell you that YOU can't have a bacon sandwich.  And they're damn sure not going to murder you for it.  But in this case, the reaction was to threaten violence and murder for eating that sandwich.  So, in response, scores of people said \"We'll be damned if you're going to scare us into not eating bacon sandwiches just because YOU don't think it's right.  We're ALL getting bacon sandwiches!\"\n",
      "\t\t>>\t \"somewhere printed such an image publicly THAT CAUSED the Muslim extremists to react.\" No, someone CHOSE to react to a printed picture. Every day someone may hurt someone else's feelings, but as rational and respectful human beings, we let it go.  The first \"bacon sandwich\" can exist for any reason whatsoever and requires no justification or apology.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I think the only purpose on satirizing the muslim prophet is in establishing that nothing is sacred.  If one thing is considered sacred then it is up to some arbitrary line over which you get executed for expressing yourself.  It is important that that line doesn't exist.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t So basically, The World saw a Big Red Button in the Muslim faith and couldn't help but press it. So, we started it.   Now, of course, any rational human being would say \"that offends me, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that\" instead of \"I'm going to decapitate your whole family.\" That's where my sympathy stops, and I re-side with the rest of The World.   But basically, you walked into a Deli and overheard the shop owner on the phone with his wife saying \"Boy, does bacon offend me.\" Then you step up to the counter with a devilish grin and say, \"I'll have a bacon sandwich. Haha.\"   Whether the shopkeeper simply frowns or pulls out a shotgun at that point is moot, as far as my argument goes. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Bacon sandwiches have some purpose, represent some good to the people consuming them. That is in fact the primary purpose of consuming a bacon sandwich. It is *possible* to be offensive while consuming a bacon sandwich, but that is not the intention of most people eating bacon sandwiches.  The purpose of these cartoons is not nourishment or enrichment. I would argue that their primary purpose is not even entertainment. They exist for no other reason than to insult a group of people. You can choose to be a dick to someone, and you don't deserve to be killed for it. But no one should pretend like you're a hero for choosing to to be a needless dick to a group of people.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t No, you're playing it like someone found out that Jews don't approve of bacon, so opened up a bacon shop in the middle of their community and went around laying bacon on everyone's doorsteps.    The point here was never to antagonize anyone.  We didn't walk into a clearly Jewish deli and, with a big asshole grin on our face, say \"Give me some bacon\".  We were sitting in a deli that proudly serves bacon, and someone walked in and demanded that we not eat it.  Just like these cartoons weren't published in the parts of the world where they would offend.  They were published in western countries where freedom of expression is an understood concept.  It is the offended parties who showed up and started screaming.  The battle was not taken to them, it was brought to us.   Your analogy would be more apt if we had gotten these cartoons into the papers in Saudi Arabia, or flown over the area dropping paper copies of the cartoons onto Muslim communities with the sole intention of pissing them off.   \n",

Many of today's cartoons also contain valuable commentary and criticism, also being a big FU to those who want to prevent an image of a guy being published. (I can only assume because of the fear of accidentally worshipping him as a false Idol). Cartoons that didn't mock muhamed are just as inflamatory as those that do.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That's not true at all.  Political cartoons don't exist just to piss people off and make fun of people.  They've been around for centuries as a way to make an editorial point in a way that words can't effectively accomplish.  They *do* exist to persuade, to educate, to encourage conversation. There are undoubtedly plenty that DO just aim to piss people off, but to say that anyone drawing a political cartoon is just trying to start a fight is incorrect.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t You're changing the level of generality here to shift the debate. Yes, political cartoons absolutely have a purpose, no one is arguing otherwise. But the cartoons depicting Muhammad in a crude and vulgar manner only exist to inflame and insult. I have yet to see one cartoon that depicts Muhammad as a racist Arab caricature that serves a higher purpose.  In a free society, people don't need a high purpose to publish anything they choose to draw. This much is true. But we should not paint these cartoonists as martyrs. They intended to inflict pain upon a community. You might not recognize the psychic pain of a Muslim who loves Muhammad and sees him depicted as a crook nosed rapist as something worthy of your contemplation, but that doesn't mean the pain doesn't exist.  Some individuals in the group these cartoonists intentionally hurt chose to retaliate with violence. This is of course inexcusable and an order of magnitude worse than the original offense. The men who did this deserve no quarter in any civilized society. But a civilized society should likewise not canonize the original malicious intent of the cartoonists as a form of nobility.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well, I doubt you're going to find any comic that isn't poking fun, since that's the point of a comic, to illustrate a point, but the comics in question are no more offensive than any other political cartoon that pokes fun at every other religion imaginable.  \n",

I would point out that what the OP is looking for is much harder to get a clear bead on. Basically we would need to pair such an image with someone attempting to censor it, which requires digging into very recent history (usually incredibly obscure).\n",
      "\t\t>>\t We've come back full circle to the beginning of this discussion.  There are two different sets of cartoons in play here: 1) The original political cartoons years ago that started this backlash against cartoonists depicting Muhammed.  These cartoons were not meant to offend.  They weren't drawn as just some crude and vulgar way to incite anger in people.  They were drawn, like any other political cartoon, to make a political point.  The response from Islamists was \"You can't do that because our faith forbids it.\"  They responded with threats of violence (and in some cases actual violence.) 2) Later cartoons that were drawn in counter-response to those threats.  These are the comics about which you're now talking.  The ones that definitely ARE meant to make a strong point and offend.  Those comics are very much standing up for free speech since they are a direct response to those that seek to take that freedom away through violent means.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I think OP is just an apologist.  It doesn't matter whether people were trying to offend the Islamic faith or it's followers.  The point is that these comics are always meant to offend someone, and people of the Islamic faith think they should get special treatment because they have a law against it. Printing an image of Muhammad is just as much standing up for free speech as newspapers printing \"Jesus never died for your sins\" in the hypothetical world where Christians killed someone over writing that. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t The full circle is actually a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where one negative action begets a further destructive response. This isn't rhetorical: what was the point of the original Muhammad cartoons? To show \"them\" that we could, their feelings be damned? Something else?  Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should do something. My contention is that the original cartoonists used their right to free expression in a nasty, childish, and destructive manner. The response was a crime against humanity and I don't want to blame the victims for that, but we should not be glorifying the provocateurs as martyrs who upheld our values. No, they abused them.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t > Why do you need to keep doing it? I agree that people should have the right to say and print what they wish, but why do you need to be a dick for no reason? They had a reason. Satire like that is generally used to depict the absurdity of a social or political topic or situation in ways, that can't be expressed as well by other means. In the case of the recent Mohamed caricatures were in response to the death threats issued to earlier caricatures (that had a different intent, that is irrelevant to this). The caricatures were openly mocking those death threats by existing, throwing the attempt to censor artists in the face of those extremists. From a more abstract point of view, they further revealed the absurdity by inciting more death threats. In short: Those initial death threats (and not the offence of moderate Muslims) was the reason for the caricatures. They were an statement of resistance against the attempt to suppress opposition by death threats using the means of satire.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That world not hypothetical. Christians have indeed killed people for blasphemy.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > My contention is that the original cartoonists used their right to free expression in a nasty, childish, and destructive manner. And that's the part I take issue with. The cartoonists that drew these are not Muslim (presumably).  They don't live in a Muslim country, they didn't grow up with Muslim culture, and they don't live under Muslim law.  So they drew cartoons lampooning something just like they do politicians, celebrities, and other religious figures, because where they live and grew up, there's nothing immoral about that.  Your morals are a function of the culture you grew up in.  They didn't do it to antagonize.  They did it for the same reason they draw anyone else.  To make a political argument.   The point of the first cartoons was not to show anyone anything.  The point of the LATER cartoons was exactly to \"show 'them' that we could.\"  \n",

Yes, they may as well, because they don't really matter.  What is the meaning of life?  It doesn't matter whether you read Dostoyevsky or the top post on /r/trees.  You are going to have to figure out what your life is about for yourself.  Philosophy has no verifiable insights about the world.  What is a good life?  The correct system of ethics?  How should we govern?  What is justice?  These are all fundamental philosophical questions, that, despite centuries of effort, are entirely unanswered.  As a challenge to philosophy: Name the biggest accomplishment in the past ten years for your field.  Fifty?  It is worth noting that no other field of study would have a second's pause at listing their greatest recent achievement.  But philosophy will have to stretch mightily to claim anything that sounds the least bit credible. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t >Why restrict it to 50 years? I can name all sorts of accomplishments that philosophy has contributed to throughout history  So... none?  One reason to restrict it to fifty years is to try and dodge the tiresome effort that every philosophy apologist will attempt, which is to claim big things that happened in the past as the products of philosophy.  For example: \"Some of the founding fathers read philosophical books, probably, ergo, philosophy invented America.\"  >The American Republic didn't just arise out of thin air  The American Republic was founded by experienced statesmen, building off of a long and storied legal tradition.  You can't just wave your hands while writing the names of a few philosophers and expect that to be persuasive.  To what extent did philosophers build America?  What about it couldn't have been made, or made better, without them?  >There are absolutely methods for determining 'good' and 'bad' philosophy. Philosophers use logic and reason to differentiate between 'good' philosophy and 'bad' philosophy.  Name any thing that philosophy has produced, discovered or invented in the past fifty years.  Go on, blow my mind.  Give any major philosophical question and the answer to it.  List three points of Ayn Rand's philosophy, show that they are wrong and why. \n",

That's partly because Apple's $1000 laptop is a genuinely phenomenal machine - even when I'm surrounded by more powerful or capable computers, I often choose to use my MBA instead because it's so much nicer to use.  On the other hand, I would not buy a Mac mini over a comparably priced PC desktop. The mini just isn't as good for the price as the MB is. And indeed, I own a MBA and a desktop PC for those reasons.

Since I use my computer constantly, I want a computer that gives me the most comfortable usage. That's what Macs are good for. That's worth the extra $3-500 if you're a power user, hell, it'd be worth the extra $800 if your price claim wasn't ridiculous to begin with.

At my university (in Denmark) we operate with both \"formal preprerequisites\" (i.e. you must have taken this/these specific course(s)) and \"suggested background/academic qualifications\" (i.e. you should have knowledge in these areas). The former is rarely used, and usually only in situations where it would be literally dangerous to the students if they don't have proven qualifications (e.g. if they are to handle dangerous equipment/materials/chemicals in a lab). There are also formal prerequisites on your secondary education for being enrolled into the degree program.  We don't have a problem with people scores of unqualified students in courses. Consequently it doesn't lower the level of the entire class either. At least not according to student evaluations and the teachers. Anecdotally, I've also taken many coursed and been a TA on a few, and none of them had the problem either.  Students know they'll get slaughtered if they enroll in a class they're not qualified for. The few people who do anyway just fail.  I've been vicechairman for our study board of mathematics and computer science for about two years. Some of our responsibilites are quality assurance and development of educations as well as defining the degree curriculum for educations within our area that are offered by the university. There is no data to support that we suffer from your hypothetical problems.

This creates more demand for the class which makes it even harder to get into. Its bad for the students that are not prepared and its not fair to the students that are prepared but aren't able to take the class because so many people are failing and retaking it. Often times professors have the option to waive a prerequisite if they think that the student is adequately prepared for the class in question through other means. This option has always existed. The fact that some professors choose not to use it is usually based on their own experience, observing how students without the prereqs do in their classes. While this may harm some high achieving students, as a general policy it also benefits all the other students trying to take the class. Its not a perfect system but its better than the alternative. \n",

There is a significant difference between criticism, which can range from constructive to rude to destructive, and shaming, which is not only destructive but must also carry a significant amount of weight to qualify. Additionally, the exception for criminal acts is based both on the distinction of it being an action and the harm that laws are (ostensibly in some cases) designed to prevent.  As such, to state that we should not shame anyone for possessing an immutable trait is not to say that we cannot criticize, nor is it to say that we cannot shame them for actions clearly delineated as destructive.

The major difference between these and empathy is that they are much easier to change. For example, a child who has never been exposed to sufficient emotional information will be unable to develop the neural networks necessary to process it. This is evident when comparing children raised in environments where emotions are frequently being acknowledged and discussed or not, and also children who have been neglected. Although training can improve it somewhat, if they are too old they will basically never be able to process emotions normally. Often they suffer Alexithymia as a consequence as well.\n",

Wages are just one of many factors in inflation and aren't really even the largest one. Businesses still have to deal with adjusting prices from almost every other commodity as trades occur in the market. I fail to see how the labor market is any different from another commodity.   Automatically adjusting wages would create some inflation but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. A small amount of inflation encourages people to spend money instead of saving it which spurs economic growth. Keynes best described this as the paradox of thrift where saving money hurts the economy.  The Fed would still have plenty of other tools to control inflation not the least of which is the interest rate. Recently getting the inflation rate to go up has been much harder than bringing it down.  Full disclosure: I'm not an economist either but am interested in economics.\n",

The money that goes to higher wages is taken partially from less pay to owners, less product being bought and forcing employees to be more efficient.\n",

They all influence each other in many different ways. Thats what unions are for, historically, to be able to control the prices of the labor market.  Exactly and the biggest driver is monetary policy. Even though costs would get pushed higher through wages if I can't get a loan to open that second location or have to pay a high interest rate I will be deterred from doing so. This will reduce demand and help keep inflation in check.  The thing about unions is there are many cases in which they have actually backfired. Strong unions created such high costs that it lead to outsourcing to countries which didn't have that problem.  > I am personally against minimum wage completely, as I believe it actually hampers the labor market.But you did mention in the OP that this is a discussion you don't want to get into.  Yes exactly. It's not that I don't care about people's responses to this it's that I believe it will be a distraction from the the idea of auto adjustment.

Don't go together. The poor were *not* paying \"Nothing\" before. in fact they were paying a lot.  Food stamps are paid for by the government through taxes. Some of those taxes come directly from the bottom 40% of income earners (about 10%). So right off the bat they're paying 10% of the price of those food stamps (because money is fungible).  The remainder of taxes are on things like income, capital gains, inheritance and payrolls. These are not *directly* paid for by the bottom 40% of income earners. *But they still pay for those taxes through higher prices*. The exact same mechanism that, in your eyes, passes the burden of a minimum wage onto low income and fixed income people (prices) also passes the burden of capital gains taxes, income taxes, corporate profit taxes etc... Not *all* of the burden is passed in either case, but a fair amount of it is.  Are they, on balance, paying more than they were before? Definitely not. Why? Because everyone making minimum wage got a raise. Everyone making just above minimum wage probably got one as well. Everyone who shares a household with one of these earners got a raise. These people are overwhelmingly (for obvious reasons) low income earners.  *Part, and only part* of that raise is cancelled out by higher prices.

As for addressing his argument that individual psychopaths who have infiltrated nuclear weapons control teams could fire off the nukes - this misunderstands the nature of psychopathy. A psychopath may want to instantly kill millions of people, but the rules of MAD still apply. Psychopaths are extremely self-centered and knowing that they would probably die as a result of firing the weapon would be enough to deter them from doing so. They are also very intelligent and would know this before joining the program, likely choosing a different path to fulfill their urges.  Additionally we have to remember that psychopaths make up 1% of the non-prison population in the US and the majority of them never become violent.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > Hypothetically there's nothing to stop a non-centralized fringe group from using a nuke in a terrorist plot if they could ever get their hands on one.  A non-centralized fringe group that has sufficient organization to get hold of nukes should have at least one person level-headed enough to realize that the threat of a nuke is worth more than the visibility of having used one but no longer possessing such. After a fairly short period with access to this threat, any capable group would have territory of their own to defend and would fall under MAD.  This doesn't mean that the threat of a nuke being acquired by such a group is not substantial, just that it is unlikely to manifest in the actual usage of the nuke.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t You're assuming that the only thing that all fringe groups want is territory, therefore MAD will eventually apply.  You forget that a lot of these groups out there aren't after land, but rather attempting to simply destroy other group's ideals or bolster their own.  MAD doesn't save us from people like this.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Even if they aren't particularly enamored with territory, using force to bring about their ideals generally means competing with others who would use force to eliminate their group. Control of territory removes this threat and allows them to enforce their ideals within that territory. The threat of a nuke holds the other force at bay. The use of the nuke will usually fail to fully destroy the other force and invites it to attack.  The difference between a nuke and a terrorist attack is that the terrorist attack has to be demonstrated before being treated as a credible threat. It has no power without at least a one-time implementation. The nuke is a credibly proven threat by the simple proof that one possess the nuke. Possession of an ICBM delivery vehicle increases the threat greatly, but isn't strictly necessary for it's existence.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I think you're vastly overestimating the value of territory to some of these groups.  That, and just because a group controls a piece of territory doesn't mean that they actually hold a claim to it.  Example, if ISIS were to nuke the US or Israel that doesn't mean that we'd be able to respond with a counter nuke of ISIS territory since Iraq, Syria and other actual countries still claim ownership of those regions.  You can't nuke ISIS because that would royally piss off the actual countries who claim sovereignty over those areas.  You're also forgetting that a lot of these fringe groups are highly mobile and spread out.  Take AQ for instance, they've got strongholds in several countries in several of the Stans, Yemen, Iraq, etc.  So if they coordinated a nuclear attack on the US where exactly are we supposed to retaliate?  They're simply not concentrated in one easy to invade area.  Heck, I would be willing to bet that if we nuked every known stronghold simultaneously that they'd still have a few that we don't know about operational.  These groups just don't operate like states.  You simply can't retaliate against them like you would against an actual state.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t All of this is why territory is only part of the equation. Prior to attaining a solid and defensible territory, the group is substantially vulnerable. The ability to threaten with a nuke to accomplish a defense of their group or even gain concessions from once-enemies is a great boon to such a distributed group. Territory provides other options with which to obtain these things by force, and is the only reason it must be considered.\n",

Let's use an example: Given a coin-flip with a unknown outcome to all parties, you could argue the belief that the coin turned out heads. So headists would state \"It turned out heads.\", hard aheadists would state \"It didn't turn out heads.\" (and it therefore follows that it has to be tails) and soft aheadists would state \"I'm unconvinced that it turned out heads.\" (but he may also be unconvinced that it turned out tails!)

Not quite as dramatic as predicted by Keynes, but still a decrease.  ¹ It still doesn't include children under 16, but it's arguable on which side should students be counted anyway.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Way longer than the 30s, actually.  The Luddites were protesting against automated weaving looms in the early 19th century because they thought it would put them out of work.  You know what?  They were right.  They all lost their jobs.  The economy readjusted, and the automation gains contributed to increased standards of living for everyone, in the long run.  Automation has been happening for millennia.  Think of how many hunter-gatherers lost their jobs when we figured out you could grow food in the ground.  Think of all the laborer jobs that were lost when we realized you could have an oxen pull a wheeled cart.  Automation has led to increased income throughout history, and there's no reason to think that trend will suddenly reverse itself.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Disagree. Technological progress isn't linear. Artificial intelligence and the hardware and software that underpins it are becoming more advanced *at an increasing rate*.   >They've been saying this since the 30s.  It wasn't a realistic fear in the 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. It is now.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t The difference is in the scope of jobs being replaced - not just manufacturing but even intellectual professions, including writing, analysis, finance, medicine... Many people today probably would believe that a computer doing a doctors job would be closer to science fiction than fact, despite the fact that it's already real. And while other jobs develop to replace those automated, the rate of job creation will not always outpace job loss. That's what OP is concerned about (me too), and you haven't addressed that.   It's also worth noting that our longer hours are a symptom of economic inequality, not a failure to automate more work. You can't just assume this casualty you're implying. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t > They've been saying this since the 30s. Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, instead we are working longer hours than ever.  Being \"on the clock\" and being productive are completely different things.  Case in point, I, like probably many of you, are at work right now.  I *could* be doing work, but there is so much bureaucracy and nonsense that gets in the way that it's hardly worth doing more than the bare minimum.  Fortunately, I don't work at a company where I need to pretend to work long hours (I do work sometimes after hours but that's because something has to be done outside of business hours.)  In general, I'm in the office 40 hours a week in order to be available if someone needs me.  If I'm stuck waiting on emails, processes, and meetings to happen before I can do my work, then I'm on reddit.  What is a big problem is that the majority of office workers are goofing off, and getting paid decent amounts to do it.  The reason we have jobs is because there are people in management who want to make more money and become powerful, and they need staff to justify it.  So the more employees in their departments, the more powerful they are.  Contrast that with the unemployed and underemployed, some of which would be more qualified to work in an office than many, and it's a strange, unstable system just waiting to collapse.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I'd just like to point out that the extra working hours are a completely arbitrary thing and are not needed. The concept of a 8 hour workday has been ingrained for so long in our culture that even if you have nothing to do you are expected to be at work for 8 hours a day, in most jobs. This leads to either giving you nothing to do, or making you do stupid shit, or building more administrative bullshit to keep up with to waste everyone's time. We are working longer hours, but we are working less than ever before. So take that \"longer hours\" thing with a grain of salt. It truly is meaningless for most people\n",

      "\t\t>>\t 80 years in the history of humanity is nothing. 300 years of industrial revolution is nothing in the history of trade.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t It won't change if we keep inventing new jobs like we did in the past. But at one point that will be pretty hard to do when most manual labor goes into robot hands. Look what happened to agriculture. Now imagine this happens to basically all manual labor. Pretty horrifying in my opinion.  Not to mention, automation will also find its place in non-manual labor too.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That argument is tenuous at best.  I see it used every single time someone brings this up, but automation is now reaching some areas that people considered secure, such as the service industry.    There has always been some type of work that required a lot of labor, whether it be manufacturing, construction, data entry, electronics or the service industry.  The manual labor requirements aren't shrinking too fast, but they are shrinking.  The localized labor is the part that keeps towns/cities functional.  When the big labor users automate it has big impacts.    Chili's and others are testing automated tablets for you to handle everything yourself, so you can get rid of waiters and just downgrade to bussers, which will be paid less and get less tips because they aren't providing as much service.  Stores had mixed success with self checkout, but they will continue to improve them until they are the norm.  In 5-10 years you will simply walk your cart up to a register and it will read the RFID chips and have you swipe your card and go.    Yes, people work longer hours because companies can push their employees harder, companies LIKE you to be afraid to lose your job.  Fear that a single illness will put you in the poor house is great for labor management.  Keynes isn't completely wrong, there is a lot of inefficiency in the system on purpose... people make companies that do similar things to other companies, so diversification of things like clothing and cars help keep labor busy, for now.   \"It hasn't happened yet\" is not a solid argument.  Automation is happening faster, and we also added in a global work force.  3D printing, cheaper robotics and more complex automation will have a major impact in the next 20 years because the government will have to solve the growing underemployment problem one way or another, and the moment large corporations don't have the ability to take advantage of their employees they will quickly reduce their need for them further.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t This assumes linear growth of technology, when in fact technology may actually grow more or less exponentially.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t The world is different now from the 1930s. This counter argument is irrelevant. We are way more connected to each other as countries are too and wider also. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I don't agree, the technology didn't exist back then to be able to fully automate things like building cars. Now, we have extremely precise robotics and computer systems that are complex enough to adapt in real time. It's easy to use your imagination when thinking about the potential long term effects of a new thing/behavior and be pretty accurate. So, I don't think the fact that it didn't happen 80 years ago is any indication about the likelihood of it happening now.  On the other hand, not all industries are really susceptible to automation. For example, the medical industry requires bedside manner which is the obvious thing preventing automation. Medical workers rely on their ability to get important information from patients who are vague, deceitful, or simply don't know enough to concisely communicate their problems. On top of that, emergency medical workers work in some of the most unpredictable environments that exist. The physical dexterity in tight spaces coupled with navigating an unpredictable terrain is enough to make robot ambulances a monumentally difficult thing to achieve. It's possible it would happen eventually but it will require not only better artificial intelligence than we are capable of making currently as well as a complete overhaul of the way we build houses to allow a robot to even access most patients in the first place.  Compare this to something like fast food or manufacturing. Flipping burgers or even cooking complex dishes can DEFINITELY be reduced to a repetitive process that a machine could accomplish.  I think people will experience more of a shift of desired expertise rather than a complete elimination of people from jobs in the near future. At least until technology improves further. Eventually, it WILL happen. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Is work hours really all OP is worried about?    I feel like this argument is akin to telling me rocks are diet foods by focusing in on how little calories they have.    How will wealth be effected for the classes?  What types of jobs will we be left with to perform for 40 hours a week?  Will we share in the wealth produced?  Will tasks become more menial?    Having the same amount of hours to work seems threatening in and of itself.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t yes but the problem was that that automation effected 1 smallish section of the economy. we can be generous and say that the weaving industry was 10-20% of the workforce, but that pales in comparison to the job loss automation is set to clean up when driverless cars hit the market. not to mention that production robots are becoming much smarter so virtually all manufacturing can be automated. when the weavers lost their job they were just able to switch to other menial task work. but automation is set to completely erase all menial work jobs unless you're willing to work for slave labour wages.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Throughout human history there has been at least one skill that a human had and a machine did not. In the not too distant future that will no longer be true. Your line of thinking about historical patterns is analogous to citizens of a planet drifting into its star saying \"oh it has been getting warmer for thousands of years and nothing bad has come of it, we have always just adjusted, why should it be any different if we hit the star?\" \n",
      "\t\t>>\t It's not just automation, but also cost and time saving initiatives. That would be fine if it were passed on to the customer or used to pay higher wages, but generally it is just used to generate higher profits/put into a CEOs bank. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Speed.  The speed with which these technological jumps is increasing similar to Moore's Law.   The only thing we have to remove from our culture is the \"Sanctity of Work\" malarkey we've got going right now, and the answers will become apparent.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t And even if automation will somehow make fewer jobs there is probably no good reason to be scared of it. Not working and getting money is not that bad. We can still all become artists or just do what we want to do all day like growing our own food, reading and raising kids. The taxes will just have to be high enough for all to get a reasonable income. And since progress has only come with higher productivity so far, we will probably see fewer people earning much more - paying more in tax. But even taking all that into consideration we still have not seen this technology that makes us jobless and poor effect in real life. Only uneducated people have suffered the people not able to adjust, learn or move to better jobs. So why do we expect this effect now? Trade barriers to protect jobs such as mining and steelwork has not improved the economy it just made sure that some people could continue doing their old job and not finding a new job. Even Detroit is adjusting and becoming a rich city again, just smaller.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > The economy readjusted, and the automation gains contributed to increased standards of living for everyone, in the long run.  I find it weird how common and emotionless that view usually is. It's a bit like saying that all you need is a good holocaust to weed down a population and get rid of undesirables, and you'll then have increased standards of living for everyone in the long run thanks to the redistribution of wealth and land. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t fucking. no kidding. just ask /r/talesfromtechsupport  Actually, that's a good explanation of how (eventually) automation is going to run people out of jobs. Automation isn't multiplying the amount of work people can do, the way the industrial and digital revolutions did. It's REMOVING human slowness and incompetence from the equation. \n",

Many weavers likely aged out and retired shrinking the weaver workforce, until the very end where a small percentage of the original weavers are fired.

Second of all, human productivity will be a rounding error compared to the sheer power of machines. Getting 0.0001% more efficiency might not be worth some of the headaches of hiring employees (who by the way will likely be feeling pretty unfulfilled and depressed being second class undervalued workers). I recommend you read Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut since his world is a bit like the one you propose but morale is a huge problem.  Third, efficiency is meaningless if you have more efficiency than you could possibly use. The earth has a finite amount of resources and a finite amount of consumers. If the machines you have can process all available resources and or make more than enough goods to meet demand and still have time when they are not needed than extra efficiency isn't particularly helpful.   Last but not least, employees strike, they need benefits, there are safety regulations, they bother you to buy girlscout cookies.

As such, what you contribute to the pool of labor is essentially your value to society, whether that be through picking up and putting down heavy things, inventing, fighting off other societies, entertaining others through art, etc.  As we reach post-scarcity, that correlation starts to dissolve. We don't really need everyone to work as hard as possible anymore. However, as a society we know of no other way to value people, so we create busy work for them to do.  The most apparent example is that politicians are constantly talking about \"jobs\" as if they're important, when all that really matters is quality of life. We'll throw quality of life down the drain in order to create jobs just so we can say people are employed, even if they're doing absolutely nothing productive with that employment.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t > Automation still needs setting-up and maintenance, you're not taking the human completely out of the equation. You cite computers, yet they are a form of automation as well.  Right, but look at the difference.  Prior to computers you would employ a file clerk, a secretary, and an accountant to do what the computer does.  One excel spreadsheet does the work of an accountant in significantly less time, for a fixed cost of one week's pay for the accountant.  With phone answering systems, dictation software, wordprocessing software, etc, that's another job replaced at the cost of a month or two of pay.  File Clerk?  Windows has a search function, and you don't have to pay nearly as much to electronically store the files (even if you're paying for a data back up facility).  What used to be about 20 jobs for a smallish company working in a white collar field have now been displaced, and replaced with... what?  3 jobs in IT?  15% job replacement rate isn't sustainable.  > Will the solution of the past (just do something else) keep working or not?  No, not really.  The jobs in the production of making our lives better have been replaced steadily since the industrial revolution (for the relevant country).  The automation revolution (which history will say we're in the dawn of) will push everything to the service economy, a transition that was observed as having started under Reagan.    The problem is that a service economy is completely unsustainable without input from outside sources.  A Barista quite simply cannot afford to get coffee from another barrista often enough to keep all barristas employed, especially when a computerized espresso machine gets to the point where it can replace a starbucks employee.   To see examples of this, take a look at any tourist town.  Alternately, take a look at any town where the major industries have fallen on hard times.  The Rust Belt, for example, or Detroit.  See, the problem with Automation is that it's going to, eventually, hit *every* major industry.  It won't be a question of exporting Steel jobs or Manufacturing jobs... it's going to be a question of replacing basically *all* jobs.  If machines can replace us in making most of what we do... as jobs become more tenuous, people will be more careful about what they do with their money, meaning that the machine made cup of coffee that costs 50% but is 90% as good as the human made one will become the preferred choice, thus putting even barristas out of jobs...\n",

      "\t\t>>\t > No they wont. and no they arnt. Computers arnt any smarter than they were 40 years ago. Hell you computers dont even have a measure of smartness.  You're actually fundamentally wrong on this point.   There are basically 3 major ways of identifying intelligence in psychology: the 3-stratum model; multiple intelligences model; and the triarchic theory of intelligence. The stratum model is the one that most clearly aligns to the biological functioning of our brain and is largely gaining the most traction. The other two are useful as abstractions but do not seem to match up to how our brain actually works.   The 3-stratum model says that intelligence is really an emergent property that we see by looking at narrow specific abilities, which in turn layered up to broad abilities, and that all that together the whole of these broad abilities is our IQ.   In the AI field, specific narrow abilities have definitively increased. As just one example, chess computers can now regularly beat the world champion whereas 40 years ago they couldn't beat a decent club player. Since the stratum model says intelligence is an umbrella that covers these layers, and the lowest layer has increased, under this model computers are unarguably more intelligent than they were 40 years ago.   The other two models follow similar analysis, so I won't go into them here. But basically, as far as cognitive psychology goes -- computers are doing better in measures of intelligence.   Now you might say that passing electrons around in a brute force algorithm isn't the same as really playing chess so that isn't intelligence. But the reality is that it is the same. That is the point of the Turing test. While the underpinning computations are vastly different, the functional result is indistinguishable from an external perspective.   We don't pretend that computers are intelligent because they have a really big biological brain. We understand they are silicone and copper and plastic and metal and function at a low level much differently than humans do. But the resulting output is indistinguishable from highly intelligent human action. And that is how we measure intelligence.   Cars aren't slower than humans because they don't have legs to run on. They are still faster than humans around a track. Likewise, computers are smarter, much smarter, than they were 40 years ago, and they are on pace to put us to shame in numerous areas very, very soon (and in many areas they are doing so already).   The computer program Eugene nearly passed a formal Turing test this year for human language interaction. He convinced 10 of 30 expert judges that he was a human being. It won't be too long before that number climbs to 30 of 30. Computers aren't more intelligent than us generally, yet. But as each of their narrow specialties becomes better and better, and as networking computers together becomes easier and faster, it will not be long before a computer, or network of computers, is superior to us at every human task.   I'm not saying next week. But if the advances of the last few years continue to show as much promise as they have, the next few decades will be game changing.  \n",

And automation will have little impact on the creative fields. Automation is useful in most fields because it is cheaper and more efficient than hiring a person. In the creative fields, however, the only important factor is quality of the final product, I.e., it's ability to sell.  People won't buy a cheaper song just because it's cheaper, they'll only buy music they like.  Thus, the chief advantage of robots over people is nullified in this field.

You are right on the music thing because people like the idea of celebrities but the fact that computers can do it still means they are intelligent and can simulate creativity.  Computers don't publish original research because they don't care about anything so we have to tell them what to do. Computers play an increasingly indispensable role in science and research of people I personally know is based almost entirely on computer simulations.  First of all, genetic algorithms can make better genetic algorithms, it is experimental and it is called meta-genetic programming. You are right though, I know very little about meta-genetic programming, only that there is work on it. Second of all, the quote of mine you called a bald faced lie is basically the definition of genetic algorithms. Better is subjective and by better I meant in terms of the fitness algorithm. If you include efficiency in that algorithm somehow then the genetic algorithm will improve in that respect.

The first one is yours, that prison is there to separate and resctrict freedom for the inmate. This lead to mexican style prison(not official name), in witch they have city inside the prison with people living there lives normally complete with elections, buying better houses and even a judicial system and a prison inside the prison!  Then you have the old testament style prison (idem), in witch the goal of the prison is though to be to punish people, the prisons in the USA (please correct me if I am wrong, I would love to be wrong about this :). In it you have story of people evading from prison to get basic healthcare done (like going to the dentist after three week of pain!).  And finally you have the Scandinavian style prison where the goal of the prison is seen as \"reeducating\" the inmate until they are again deemed \"fit to the society\". In it you have story like mass murderer complaining of \"only\" having a PS2 instead of a PS3 to play with.  Personally I am a fan of the 3rd type but I'll admit that each type has its flaw and each correspond of a different worldview  Now back to the point, you have to recognise that your point make sense under old testament style prison, but not under Mexican prisons and less under the Scandinavian one (if you're gonna spend money on getting someone to be productive again you want him/her to live linger so you get more for your work but it start being an economical decision)\n",

It struck me as the kind of voice used while exercising or playing sports more than anger. We all decode things differently, but I honestly don't get where anger reading came from there.  People who react to aggressive commercials with stress have a serious problem, because if they are being seriously stressed by commercials then they would be seriously stressed by daily interactions with people on the street.

      "\t\t>>\t When going up against an officer it's pretty much guilty until proven innocent. Everyone is inclined to believe the word of an officer against an alleged criminal.   For the situations in which officers should not be wearing cameras:  Undercover: If it's about cover being blown by a visible camera, would a microphone not suffice? And for situations in which wearing any recording instrument could jeopardize the officer's life, like entering a drug fortress, we can assume the officer wouldn't be using any brutality, either.  Courtroom: This is not a place where many conflicts between officers and citizens take place. And if they do, it's a courtroom, full of witnesses to testify brutality.  Confidential informants: Why not record? It's the police department that's organizing the meeting. They already know about the informant. If anything a camera/microphone would prevent an officer from twisting the informant's statements. The department wouldn't be relying on memory.

So I think his system makes perfect sense - assuming the cop is acting properly, he should always have the camera on. The only cops that benefit from body camera malfunctions are the corrupt and abusive ones.  Thus, we should assume that camera malfunction means possible abuse or corruption. This creates incentives where the good cops wear reliable cameras and keep spares on hand in case of malfunction, whilst the abusive cops are much more easily identified by repeated camera blank spots and repeated incidents of tampering with their cameras.  Finally, you're right that there are plenty of situations where police should not be expected to wear body cameras. That is when you take them off.

It was used most importantly(to the story) on the oldest, most central tree. The first tree. The tree that provided the seeds which eventually became the entire rest of the [4]chard.  This tree, and those similarly doused with pesticide, began to produce rotten [apple]s each harvest. It began with only a small number of [apple]s per harvest, and the rot seemed to be exclusive to those trees. In a short time however, it was evident that not only had the poison began to spread via the old trees' central root systems to the rest of the ever-expanding [4]chard, but that the pesticide was ultimately ineffective at eradicating it's intended target. Ironically the pest would prove to be *so* persistent that it eventually developed a taste for the fruit of the poisoned trees in particular. So while ever-present throughout the rest of the [4]chard, the insignificant pest that was deemed capitally offensive to the young garden in it's infancy eventually took up primary residence in the very trees that drastic measures had been taken to protect.   Over time, while the [4]chard continued to grow in the number of trees and overall quantity of [apple]s produced, each harvest produced more and more rotten fruit and less and less quality, refreshingly unique [apple]s. A symptom of the original poisoning invading the root system of the entire [4]chard, it wasn't long before trees throughout, even those planted years later, would begin to exhibit signs of the same ills.   Today the [4]chard has massively increased in the number of trees on the plot, but the the overall quality of the fruit has experienced a noticeable and rapid decline over the years, with the discovery of truly fantastic and deserving [apple]s becoming more infrequent overall. The trees that were originally exposed to the toxicity are mere husks, crawling with parasites and very rarely producing fruit worth eating. They can't be cut down now for the same reason they were praised and admired long ago. They're integral to the root system of the entire [4]chard, and representative of the great and original idea that was the foundation for the [4]chard itself.    If you've the time and patience to sort through all of the semi-fermented garbage hanging about and don't mind trying to ignore all of the annoying insects who've invaded the place, a brilliantly creative or otherwise distinguished specimen of an [apple] can still be gleaned from this hopeful collective that once seemed to have limitless potential.

But to gain a sense of meaning in their lives in a manner which is very circumspect.  And my point was that it had nothing to do with shame, or even equality for that matter. The movement was about *equity*, not equality, two very different things. Most people are totally ok with a wealth gap. Most people are not, however, totally ok with [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Inequality-by-Kenworthy.png). That's an absurd growth for the upper class, and there's no argument that their contribution to society is worth *that much more* than the entirety of the other 99% of the population. Until you can disprove that premise, you have no right or reason to chalk it all up to a hurt sense of self worth.  > But this is the internet  Oh, I'm sorry, I guess that makes baseless arrogance totally ok.

That is a reactionary measure, not aware of its actions. Not trust-able to act in accordance with sensibility.  Again, this is equal parts arrogance and sheltering. You're implying that because someone is wealthy, their opinions will naturally be more nuanced and intelligent. I have friends ranging from poor to rich, and I can assure you, I see no significant correlation to their economics and intelligence.

Like government corruption and systemic inequality and unethical financial practices and the factors you can easily read about if you so much as look at the wikipedia page.  At least, I think that's what you mean by \"the 99% was people realising they do not matter.\" You mean the feeling of being powerless as an individual, right?

Not the knowledge of being less powerful due to the inequality that exists in the US Democratic/Capitalist government/economic system and the conclusion that such a system is unjust?\n",

Money does equal well being up to a point. There is diminishing returns on happiness to money though, but just makes for a stronger argument against a rapidly increasing income for the 1% since it won't increase their well being nearly as much as it would for people with lower income. And again, it's about equity. The idea that someone should be valued for the work they contribute. In theory, with an equitable society, as the economy gets stronger, everyone should benefit, and yet we only see increases in those with the highest income. We *should* live in an equitable society. The whole point of a democratic society is to be as fair to as many people as is possible, and in this regard, the system has utterly failed a huge swath of people. I'd say they have every right to be angry about that.  > You were falling into territory that wasn't going anywhere with superlative language.

Wait.  K, so you're just basing it on what \"feels\" right to you then, got it.  > 'The 1%' and 'they' are referring to different groups .  Yes, \"they\" is referring to the 99% movement. How is that twisting your words?  > if the 1% is over valued, then isn't they (the 99%) under valued?  The two are certainly related, but the difference of phrasing is significant. As I said, most people are ok with a wealth gap, and focusing on the undervalue adds an implication that that isn't the case, that everyone should be equal (as you said), while focusing on the overvalue is pointing out that there's no good reason for that gap to exist, and that this isn't equitable.  > Not really interested in your observer bias.  Right, but *your* observer bias is totally ok and using your facebook friends as a basis for 15 thousand people is totally fine.  > Never said they were better, but the wealthy do tend to have more say.  Say in what exactly? Politics? Society?  > I'm not saying they don't matter. I'm saying they thought it of themselves as a group, and were acting out from that belief as a group.  And I'm saying it wasn't about how much they did or didn't matter, it was about the unfairness of the stupidly large wealth gap. It was the fact that in our supposedly \"all men were created equal\" society, some men born into better circumstances would result in such a dramatic and unfair situation. The point was that according to the values of this country, what is happening should not be happening. It has nothing to do with the self-worth of the 15 thousand protesters.\n",

The protest began with some university students who were dealing with massive budget cuts in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008, despite them having paid a good deal for the hope of a good future. I don't know how old you are and I don't know how you missed through 2008 (I was a kid during 2008 and the news never escaped me), but things were quite *tense* at the time.   The average wealth of the mean statistical person dropped by over 30%, and a great deal of suddenly poor people were looking for people to blame. The average wealth of the former top 1% in overall wealth had only dropped 11%, meaning that the rich were for the most part minorly inconvenienced while there were many suicides in the general population relating to bankruptcy.   In this sort of situation, people thought it would be a good idea to imitate the college protests and squat on various locations. The Spanish occupied various targets (the Great Recession affected the entire world), and some weeks/months later the Americans decided to fall suit and occupy wall street.

That's selfish of you, because you are putting your interest (not wanting to get hurt by somebody else's actions) over the interest of your friend or relative, who presumably is doing this out of their own volition, and over the interest of many other people, who presumably want to get cured of ebola, saved from fires, etc. It's kind of how people get angry at somebody who died, as part of the grieving process: you feel like the person abandoned you to deal with all these unpleasant feelings and events.

[I don't beleive it is possible](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904106704576583203589408180). Happiness, to me, equates to fulfillment, which further extends to what you can achieve. Technology substantially increases what we are able to achieve. In my mind, I equate societies with more technology as more capable, and therefore more happy.  >I think this is one such misplaced sense of meaning. It's like a religious people saying to a nonreligious person \"I actually did something meaningful with my life\" because they followed God or whatever. Any sense of meaning related to building wonders is constructed by us. Which is fine, but it's not the only one. If we were all happy and lived fulfilling lives in peace etc. then I wouldn't use the fact that we could/couldn't build wonders as a sign of our success.   Again, I disagree. If someone happy does nothing, they are forgotten after their death. If someone unhappy builds a monument, that monument exists past their death. In that, their influence extends beyond death. This makes the creator more capable than the other, and thus better. Ideally the creator would also live a happy life as well as build the monument.  >(1) Why advances in science are the measure of a societies worth?   The more technology a society has, the more capable they become. It can boil down quite simply to empirical data. A more capable society is better than one who is less capable.   >(2) This somehow gives a society justification for harming others in order to achieve that goal?   In the end, yes. As predators consume prey to thrive, a superior society can consume a lesser one to advance. It is the nature, and reality of the world, and I place value on that.  \n",

Just because social trends, a greater emphasis on attending a 4-year than ever, and a poor job market have resulted in a higher percentage of young people living with their parents for a while doesn't necessarily mean we should radically shift the legal system around this, much less force this legally-binding assumption upon all young people and deny them comparable finances unless they find a way to break out of \"traditional\" status.  Know what's silly? The fact that a Veteran with a contract that has 1 day of Active Duty outside of training purposes is considered independent the day they finish training, but a Veteran that finishes the same training and heads home the day after finishing training and goes to a Reserve/Guard unit is considered a dependent. ONLY by the Department of Education for the purpose of the FAFSA amongst ALL government agencies does this definition apply.  21-year-old Guardsmen/Reservists that are without spouse/child (like I was) have the double-whammy of being subjected to labels of independence and dependence simultaneously within this system, and being impossible to get the tax returns of my deadbeat parents to complete my FAFSA, it was sheer luck that I was getting married that year so I could be independent (thankfully I have a wonderful wife two years older than myself that also wanted to marry young). This may sound like an obscure situation, but it's not. Turns out there are a lot of college-aged people in the Guard/Reserves.  So we deal with the hands-tied aspect of supposed semi-ignorance and dependence on our parents while also having the \"deal with it/figure it out\" side that a responsible adult should have. As it turns out, not every adult has responsible parents, and it's unfair to assume that a responsible student has responsible parents. Responsible people have the documentation required to file a FAFSA. My parents weren't, and even then it's not fair to assume that every parent wants to throw around their tax return to a kid that left the house when they graduated high school and wanted to live life as an independent adult.  It's not fair to adults to force them to feign and legally agree with dependence upon their parents because of the way the system currently works, despite the fact that some people truly are dependents, because so many others of us are 100% independent and can't receive so much as a tax return from our parents to fill out our aid forms. The system lacks flexibility and it's a well-known shortfall at this point that is entirely in-line with OPs rhetoric.  A line needs to be drawn somewhere, and the age of voting or being able to leave the country or, you know, GO TO COLLEGE ought to be the age where people are able to be considered independent enough to be treated as somebody, you know, over the age of majority that, you know, is going to college. If you're old enough to attend without your parents holding your hand and old enough to receive potentially life-crippling debt for it without your parents holding your hand, you should be old enough to receive aid for it without your parents holding your hand.  In my opinion, that is.\n",

Tuition is rising because costs are rising and because students and parents are demanding better and more expensive services.

Why does it make sense that a 23 year old supporting themself since they were 18, file independently on taxes since they were 18, not allowed to file independently for financial aid.

Also I had to show I had a job and made enough to support myself and my parents weren't claiming me as a dependent. The dependent thing is crucial and most families would save more on taxes than the kid would get in financial aid, so I don't think many people would be willing to do that.   I think a lot of kids were in similar situations as I was.

I realize you are arguing that they *should* be, but it is not a shift to consider 20-year-old students dependent on their parents.  Realistically, to fund an education, 20-year-olds are going to be dependent on someone--either their parents or the government.  I have no objection to increasing government funding for higher education, but if that is what you want, you need to convince the public that it is worth paying for.

      "\t\t>>\t And when that \"market crash\" happens while the student is in school, good fucking luck. That's exactly what happened to me and I was helpless. My parents were making about $160k iirc leading up to 2008 economic fuckery. My dad was laid off that September, called me and said \"I'm sorry, we can't pay for school anymore for you, but we already made 1/3 tuition payment a couple weeks ago so you have a little time. You'll need to get loans or pay yourself.\" At 18 years old I freaked the fuck out for a couple days and seriously considered dropping out, but my now-husband encouraged me to try to find a way to pay for school first.  Financial aid office told me to contact FAFSA about it, but FAFSA said I wasn't eligible for anything based on my parents income and because I was not independent and to wait and see what happened when I filed next year. Not even subsidized loans! February 2009 my mom was laid off from her job and my dad was still out of work, surely that would be good enough for FAFSA to give me some aid. Nope! Because of my dad's severance package, and the next year my mom's severance package, FAFSA still said they made too much for me to qualify for anything. They said that every fucking year. I tried every possible avenue they offered to appeal it and have an exception made.  For fucks sake, my 2008 tax return I started claiming myself because I was legit covering half or more of my expenses for the year. If the IRS is cool with me being financially independent, why not FAFSA too? Are they not part of the same government?  Meanwhile, my parents drained their savings to take care of their other two dependents while I was 100% on my own. I think they even borrowed from their 401k to make sure the mortgage and bills were always paid. They did the math and eating $1 Whoppers on Wednesdays was cheaper than making their own burgers and buying vegetables. My dad couldn't find a job for over a year despite plenty of experience and a masters degree in his field. My mom is still, almost 6 years later, unable to find work in her field. FAFSA was unwilling to see the reality of the situation and help me out. They counted severance AND unemployment compensation toward my parents' income when calculating their expected family contribution. They were barely getting by! But somehow still made too much. Essentially, FAFSA said they weren't poor enough. To make matters worse... I appealed to my university for their in-house financial aid and they said the same thing, my parents make too much. Went to the state asking for help and they said the same.  I ended up taking unsubsidized FAFSA loans, and found a state scholarship for STEM degrees that I got, which covered 1/2 my tuition. (Fun fact: that scholarship turned into a loan the day I stopped working in the state, so I'm now paying that back too.) I paid for the other 1/2 of my tuition out of pocket working 20-30 hours per week. And my room/food/books were thankfully paid for by working as an RA. So while I absolutely recognize that I am lucky my loans aren't ridiculous now that I'm done, it's still more than it could have and should have been. I can't even imagine students taking on double the debt I did just so they can sleep somewhere and eat every day. Or triple the debt so they can focus on school and not work so much. All because of financial factors that are completely out of their control. All because their family is not poor enough. \n",

The same families that work the system so that they have to pay only capital gain taxes rather than income tax will work the system so that the state supports their child going to school.   The entire system of financial aid that we do have is based on a certain about of parents providing financial support for their kids. Financial aid is a finite amount. The bean counters have to count on the fact that some money will come from the and that money will be supported by money that comes from parents. If you create a way that people can game the system, and they will, then that can throw the balance out of whack.   And at that point it would just be best to raise taxes and give people free school. Then again in America that would probably be seen as the socialists taking over to force students into liberal indoctrination camps, so that idea won't be happening any time soon. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t If the system requires a perfect leader in charge for it to work then it is not a good system to support. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Simply because of time right now, I will provide retort that in addition to slashing direct funding of universities by the states, the Higher Education Act of 1973 guaranteeing student loans for all to cover their whole education meant that universities could inflate tuition to whatever rate they wanted and students could pony it up.   At this point in time, many young Americans will go to college, and if America can give Wall Street a bailout to the tune of 700 billion dollars, if it can afford to service the loans, it can afford to shift that money to the universities instead, and there are now two generations of Americans that have been burdened under the system established in 1973.   Once Gen X/Millenials start to run Congress, I think we'll see more reformation-minded rhetoric reflected. The current Baby Boomers had the benefit of the old systems and took it for granted, and decided to slash it when they got in control because they no longer benefited from it but rather paid into it in the form of taxation.  The difference between 50 years ago and now in the University of Wisconsin system (my own) is that universities would get ~50% of their money from the government then directly, ~50% other sources. Now the amount received directly from government is ~21%. So despite the government being unable to pay the university directly, they pay the student so the university dictates the price. It sounds backwards because it is, particularly when you consider that the government loans are coming from taxpayer dollars that the student and their family pay into.   It's as if the government decided that instead of giving you something with your money, they decided to loan your money to you with interest while another entity funded with your money (both tax dollars and now loans) names the amount with no reason except how high they can go. The government can give us our money back in the form of a loan (which is paid for by our tax dollars), but will not do so in the form of directly funding the university, despite the fact that now student loan debt is a hindrance to the economy. Certainly there's the federal vs. state government providing the funding, but there's no reason the federal government couldn't provide the funding gap.  America has no excuse at this point with the amount of money we have. It's a shame and an embarrassment that because of our choice to allow education costs to spiral out of control that we have so much student loan debt. Great nations don't look at the cost of things as important as education, they look at the cost and the benefit. America was this way once, going to the Moon in a decade. We had things to be proud of and we knew that the benefit outweighed the cost. Things like the Space Race would be unthinkable now because of budgetary constraints created by political rhetoric.  The reason universities are so expensive at this point is because of that slashing and because now they can name their price and people pay. If the government dictated the terms and covered the entirety (making student attendance a non-factor in the university's ability to fund itself), we'd remove the two-fold reason the price inflated (this inflated price is of course what led to the massive debt).  The FAFSA is the only government form that assumes 18-year-olds are dependents still. Few families truly pay any sizable sum in practice as it is, and of course private universities would be unaffected as they do their own thing and the attendants are from families that generally choose to pay the premium for the education offered. Aside from this, covering the full cost at public universities will mean higher application rates as well as no need for the university to excessively market ($5 million dollar football/basketball coaches) as they don't profit more per-head as they did before, forcing them to be more competitive academically to get the brightest kids, as well as raising the bar for entry as now many individuals with intelligence but unwilling to go due to the price point have been given a ticket.  Education should not be seen as a \"service\", it should be seen as an investment crucial to national economic and strategic interests. Pissing all over our would-be entrepreneurs with a mountain of debt, disengaging many people that could contribute to society with more value... We have no excuse at this point. The price of public university attendance should not matter what the family situation of a student is, dependent or independent (as it should not exist except marginally) as it is government-run and serviced by tax dollars (directly through subsidy and indirectly through loans paid with tax dollars).  My point is that students' status should not matter at all. I don't pay a premium to use a public road or a public park that are funded with tax dollars. It would be absurd if I had to take a massive loan paid with tax dollars to cover a certificate allowing me to drive on a road paid for with tax dollars. Yet this is what we do to our young people that are trying to become greater contributors to society. The problem in this conversation is that while most people are talking about how to cover the increasing cost of tuition, the correct question in my opinion is asking how we get rid of the cost in the first place in a system that lends our tax money back to us with interest to pay for an institution we already pay for with taxes. If the university's education is worth it, we will get that money back in the form of higher income tax as those individuals make more, as well as the societal dividends of a more educated populace and the greater tech and management we receive. If a university's education is not worth it, we can shut it down and make education more competitive. Attendance should not be based on ability to pay, it should be based on ultimate ability to contribute to society.\n",

Students from poorer families or who are independent of their parents get a larger loan (and have improved access to bursaries), but even those whose parents earn quite a lot can get something.

      "\t\t>>\t First of all, the \"people in that very specific situation\" (presuming you mean my \"market crash\" group) *do* benefit now, that's the point: I was trying to show is that because FAFSA doesn't take into account historical earnings/assets, the historical support accorded to a \"spoiled\" kid whose parents won't pay for college can't be factored in.  Second, how would OP's solution substantially disadvantage lower-class kids?  What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents.  This workaround doesn't have to be *easy*, and you can force them to prove the lack of support.  This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member.  This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation.  Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets.  (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)  To some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed.  However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant.  FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount.  Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the *only* assistance their kid was getting.  My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.  Is all of this more work for FAFSA?  Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.  Basically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students.  Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n",

My parents together make about 50k but my dad has Heart failure and my mom has MS. They are both pretty expensive diseases but that's not taken into account and at the time only my mom was on disability. But they don't take that into account that my parents have very expensive conditions (Or it didn't at the time)  Anyway, I was doing good in school and now I am a useless, fucked up waste of space with a bunch of debt who will never amount to anything.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I read your whole reply, but I'm just going to comment on a couple points.  You seem to be implying that colleges *want* to raise tuition.  They don't. With very few exceptions they aren't making more money. They raise tuition because in order to compete for students they need to spend more money.  The larger problem with your argument is that colleges are subsidized by taxpayers who paid for their own college and don't have kids.  I think we agree that that is a good thing, but it means you can't accurately say that you are giving yourself a loan. You are getting a loan from people who have already paid for their education.  If college becomes free for everyone then there will be drastically more pressure from taxpayers without kids to cut back on college services and to limit studies to areas that will be of immediate economic benefit to the public.  That isn't what is best for students.  > I don't pay a premium to use a public road or a public park that are funded with tax dollars.  There are many public roads and parks that have usage fees. In most aspects of public life we try to balance charging the general public and charging the specific people who use the public service.  Some transportation funding comes from general taxes some comes from gas taxes or car registrations.  We generally try to make these services accessible to everyone, but cost a bit more for those who benefit the most from them.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t So it doesnt *cost* the state a penny. It would just *prevent* them from charging massive amounts of money for a \"public\" service.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Yes, they definitely made more than the median household income. But I'm honestly not sure there was much wiggle room even after the lifestyle changes they made. Sure they weren't going out for drinks with friends anymore. But they still had a mortgage to pay, two dependents at home to support, etc. Cost of living is not cheap in their area (philly suburbs). There were probably expenses they could have cut back on more but I can't say for sure as I was distracted with getting my own finances in order. And the two dependents didn't know about the job losses for a while, so maybe they were keeping up appearances so the dependents' day to day wasn't disrupted. I think at first with severance and savings they gambled on finding jobs quickly while being more frugal than usual and not contributing to savings anymore, but the job market was rougher than anticipated. So while the FAFSA calculation may be consistently applied to all applicants, it does not take into account cost of living variations (but that's a whole other issue). At $100k gross income, regardless of income source, FAFSA was saying they should be contributing over $40k for the year. That itself is pretty crazy when you factor in cost of living.   Anyway. I shared my experience to highlight an example of when the FAFSA dependency status is bullshit. Quite simply, if the IRS says you're independent then so should FAFSA. \n",

      "\t\t>>\t You're not really addressing the one and only reason that financial aid is based on parents' ability to pay regardless of their willingness to pay:   There is absolutely no incentive to pay for college as a wealthy parent if your child merely has to state their financial independence. Until YOU can prove that this wouldn't be a problem in the current system, you're essentially just complaining about how life isn't fair.   The problem is that parents very rarely decide they will not fund their students education, but their children still go to expensive private colleges or out of state universities (as opposed to seeking scholarships or less expensive in state universities). Parents decide to not pay for a lot of things for their kids. The difference between poor and rich parents, though, is that not only will the rich kid have more opportunity throughout their life completely apart from how much their parents fund college, they're also going to inherit a lot more than the poor children. There can be better systems, but if you would like to disregard them in this discussion, YOU need to state how funding for actually needy families would not be split and massively reduced in order to give the money to everyone.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t sorry, on my phone it looked like i responded to the wrong comment so i deleted it :/ I'll try to find what I actually said  edit: I GOT IT!!  >Yeah, I completely agree that it's not gonna be fair 100% percent of the time. But nothing's gonna be fair 100% of the time. We just need to do the best we can with the information we can and, on average, I would bet way more lower class kids would benefit from getting a leg up getting into college than middle/upper class kids would. I mean, if you're applying to college right out of high school, the entirety of your life has been determined by your parents for the last 18 years. Those are some pretty god damn important periods of your life; having a wealthy family that can provide you with all your necessities and then some makes a HUGE difference. Are there rich parents who neglect their kids during this time? Sure. But there's got to be WAY more kids on the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum that are negatively affected and so will have a harder time with ANYTHING they want to do straight out of high school than those on the middle/high end. Once again, definitely an imperfect system. But we still need to consider what the most good we can do is, where we can do it the most.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Tuition at public schools is rising mostly because State Governments have cut funding for higher education.  I think you are drastically overestimating the percent of tuition that is paid for by federal aid.  If you want a truly \"fair\" system from the perspective of students then the government should pay for the cost of higher education--but that's incredibly unfair to the taxpayers who paid for their own education and don't have kids.  I think you should abandon your abstract idea of fair and start thinking more about the actual implications of the ideas you are proposing. If we adopted your proposal, nearly every wealthy family would cut off financial support for their kids at age 18. That would mean the government would be spending more on tuition and would end up spending more on food stamps and other assistance for teenagers who could easily be cared for by their parents. So who should pay for those teenagers?  I don't have any problem with increasing financial aid for students, but we shouldn't pretend that the money comes from nowhere.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t It's not that some people might abuse it. The objection is that if it's possible, almost every single family will use it. That means the family contribution will almost always be zero. So financial aid will be the same for all students, which is just another way of saying it won't exist.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I'll also only respond to a few too, but I'd like to remark that many of my beliefs are flexible and it's been enjoyable reading many of your points. With some of my points I play Devil's Advocate just to pursue and assess multiple sides even if I don't believe the rhetoric entirely myself.   While Driver's Licenses/License plates are fees, they are nothing close to the direct cost of the road, much less requiring massive loans. Yet the cost-per-foot of the roads are quite high. Public use and benefit for them go to all, as well as the cost. But you can also say that it's no more than the community impact of educated individuals creating new businesses, industries, and products that better the world.  Additionally, our point is the same about universities on money and their spending to attract students. Their highly-paid coaches and large stadiums are an example of their marketing department (people want to see Gator Football, for an example), and they want them to be the best to attract more students so they get more money to get better coaches, etc. I'm not saying that they do it so some Administrator makes a higher profit, though it definitely could have sounded that way. So there's clarity. :)  I should add that there's a second-factor to my rhetoric; I don't believe that we need so many people going to school, and it's been pushed much more heavily in recent decades. While I believe many people that would do great in school avoid it due to the debt burden, there are many people who simply go to college that will contribute to society with careers that don't actually need a degree. Some don't even want to go but feel they should. The government-dictated funding would provide a harder cap on how many students are allowed enrollment, pushing the standards for entry upward, meaning that a greater percentage of the students enrolled are likely those that would receive greater benefit.  Many industrialized nations offer education heavily subsidized or free compared to us. The common argument is that we're a bigger country and couldn't afford it. My reply is that because we're a bigger country we should be able to afford it more easily because we allow greater specialization in our nation with more people and a more diverse economy.  Keep in mind that US Student Loan Debt as of June 2014 was 1.2 trillion. The Stimulus of 2008 (TARP) and the Bailout of 2008 (Emergency Economic Stabilization Act) were both around 700 billion dollars. For that cost we could have entirely wiped out all existing debt that covers many years' tuition and expenses at universities. The cost for 1 year of expenses at a university, if we budgeted, is laughable, especially considering that we'd drive the cost down if universities no longer had to market so aggressively and would thereby need less money to operate. \n",

      "\t\t>>\t I'm fairly certain that \"public university\" implies that the institution is A: not for profit (to contrast it with a private institution such as Full Sail or DeVry) and B: subject to state and federal education regulations as a public university such as rules against discrimination, accepting grant/loan money from students, or filing very specific paper work. In return for being public (and meeting certain standards) the university is eligible to get government grant money or allow its degrees to be considered equivalent with other universities which offer equivalent degrees.  It's not public in the same way that a park is public or a library is public, nor is it private in the way that a business is private or a residence is private. It's not really the property of the state or run by the government; it's run according to its own officials and policies in so far as the existing rules it agrees to follow allow it to flexibly make those decisions on its own (such as who to hire or what they will charge for tuition). Using the word \"public\" in front of universities isn't meant to imply the same relationship as when its used for the \"public broadcasting service\" or even in the same way that the Postal Service is public. It's meant to contrast with the idea of a private university - which would be one that isn't regulated by the government. They purport to teach, declare that criteria for degrees have been met, and charge for their services and their students hope that when they leave, someone thinks what they learned was valuable. Since the quality of the education wasn't held to national standards, there's not a lot of confidence that a private college inspires for some people. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I don't think \"ownership\" is the right word either. At least in California, the UC system receives (some) funding from the government but is controlled by the Board of Regents, which are appointed by the governor. However that doesn't mean they are directly under his control at all; recently they raised tuition against his will.  Also, the universities are not directly tied to the federal government, which would make it impossible for the aid to come in the form of just waiving tuition fees. The end result of this aid, and unfortunately the fundamental problem with the entire system in the United States, is that all universities (especially private ones) will use it to simply raise tuition prices.\n",

Meanwhile, a school like BU only receives grants, usually for specific items, and is funded by an endowment that derives much of its money from alumni donations (please note, I'm oversimplifying here).

There are plenty of student's whose goals are not employment. Some go for the social bonds developed there, or to enable them to find a better marital partner, or to further goals other than simply finding a career. Would you burden universities by tying their successful graduates with a narrow set of restrictive employment options?  Simply put, those students shouldn't receive government funding.

Jobs and job qualifications, however, ARE the goals of technical schools, where, if I'm not wrong, the load is lightened in terms of breadth.

If so, doesn't accomplishing the goal mean the money was not wasted?  Yes, it might be true that society MIGHT (and I say might because I'm not sure about the figures on it, and I think there's a chance that the current system might break even) not be seeing a MONETARY return on investment.

      "\t\t>>\t > Drugs  This part is interesting because of the description of the complex nature of the situation. In the case of crimes resulting from drugs, I mentioned below that I believe the crime itself should be the primary offence, and the drug use which facilitated it would be a secondary offence that get tagged onto crimes. This would punish those who go crazy from drugs, without inherently punishing anyone for possession or use who has otherwise done nothing wrong. As to the rest, I understand the nature of the complex situation, but I'm not convinced that most people really think of it logically to that extent, nor that it is a problem helped by pushing it into the dark and more obscure recesses of society. Imagine momentarily a society where these kinds of drugs were legal and regulated the same way as a prescription or over the counter medication. Safe pre-made doses, regulated by bodies who can test that companies are making them to be as clean as possible, not something people have to do secretively in a dark alley trying to make sure they don't get caught. I think part of the open use would be a more constructive conversation about the potential for abuse, and a reduction in drug related crimes and deaths. When we had high school drug intervention speeches, the officers came in with posters of dead kids and stories... almost all of them ended with \"his friend saw him passed out, got scared about someone finding out, and ran away leaving him to die without medical attention\". If there wasn't the fear of punishment for using the drugs, I think a lot of these lives senselessly lost could have been saved. Beyond that... I can see what you're saying about the issues with family and state, and the complex situations that could arise... but I think the current stigma of \"just trying to get high is wrong\" marginalizes and generalized a much more complex issue without leaving open a discussion for the complexity that surrounds it.   > Incest  The big point you made was about children with parents, and about family matters. As for births, recessive genes isn't a great argument since we don't live in a eugenic society. People have disabled kids all the time, no one is legally stopping them. As for children with parents, I made the point below that it should be a discussion of people of consenting age... not that some mother was manipulating their 6 year old to pleasure them. Paedophilia is a separate debate, and something of a grey area beyond about age 14 or 15, but of course the power struggle is a concern, and I recognize that point. My argument was for 2 people above the legal age, however. As for a family dispute as a result... I think this is an issue even in normal relationships. Mother's getting attached to girlfriends and trying to get them married, the fallout afterwards... same goes for friendship circles when 2 friends date. This is an issue of openness, discussion, and the maturity of the social group. If 2 people date and then break up and it causes some kind of dilemma, that's an issue with the people not inherently the act itself. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I can tell you 100% that all drugs should be legalized immediately, everything. The science on this is rock solid and beyond question. Particularly in the case of hard drugs abuse, these people always, always have some sort of history of extreme abuse or neglect in their lives. Their brains become wired specifically toward their drug of choice, opiates, amphetamines or both. A huge part of what keeps them down is the feeling of being social outcasts - feeling unable to integrate back into society, it's easier to turn back to addiction. In situations where they are treated with dignity, given access to health services. Even giving them access to free, clean drugs ends the cycle faster and more cheaply because they aren't exposing themselves to nearly as many risks like sexual abusing themselves, criminal behavior and the risk of OD. Experiments have been done and these things have been a resounding success.  What's really happening is that the state is actually preying on these people. The vast state apparatus is proof of this, police, legal system, prisons. The corruption surrounding these entities is enormously powerful. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Actually, let's just take heroin for an example of a \"dangerous\" addictive drug. Is it really the drug that is causing the problem, or is it the person's behaviour? It's clearly the latter, since the drug is just a powder extracted from a plant, it's not inherently problematic. It's *connected* to problems, but that's not to say it directly causes them. Is addiction the culprit? Not necessarily, as being addicted to something doesn't harm anyone but the addict, and only when the addict chooses to perform antisocial actions to feed their addiction. Addiction is not even a socially devastating event in any case; plenty of cigarette smokers attest to the prevalence of benign addiction in our society. If heroin were not illegal it would cost pennies to feed a habit, meaning an addict would not have to rob or steal. If the argument is then that the intoxication leads to antisocial activities keep in mind that, again, we have plenty of intoxicating activities in our society (alcohol is the big one) and the moral fabric has not degraded to a point where we have been ruined by it. We are adults and we can choose appropriate times and places for intoxication. We forbid intoxication when it can be societally dangerous (driving, operating machines) and morally abhor it when we feel it is inappropriate (around children, etc).  There is no rational reason for us to condone some drugs and forbid others, only moral habit, ingrained by culture. Some people in the world have a greater propensity for self-destruction than others, and these people often turn to drugs to escape life and hurt themselves. This is up to them, as they are adults and they can do as they choose. It is a moral evasion for society to blame drugs for the problem and not the user, as it allows us to blame an externality for our problems rather than human nature, which is tantamount to avoiding taking responsibility for our own actions.\n",

Imagine if we increased the number of people that it was available to a thousand-fold, including people who don't think through the consequences of addiction.  The can't be a good thing.  Societal disapproval is the only tool beyond laws to prevent behavior harmful to society - and can be more effective than laws.  >Incest  No, we don't stop people from having disabled children, but we don't want to encourage situations that increase the incidence either.

If they've taken somebody else's medication and developed an addiction then, again, the real antisocial problems occur when they cannot get or afford their drugs anymore. Oxycontin sells for upwards of $30 a pill on the street, it's a crippling habit to afford. If they had their drugs cheaply available, or free, they would simply be an addict, not necessarily a destructive and antisocial addict.\n",

Stigma is finding out and disassociating from them because of it. Stigma makes it easy to demonize addicts as hopeless causes or less-than-people; I think society could be more open and honest about substance abuse without necessarily condoning it.  Also, not sure what OP was referring to, but some people when they talk about legalizing these drugs are referring to having them available by prescription as a treatment for addiction itself, for cases where abstinence or reduced use has not worked. Prescription drugs, in contrast, are a treatment for something else. Some people envision having even stricter legal controls than prescription drugs, eg having an injection facility where you can go for a controlled dose of heroin that never leaves the facility.

Alcohol is [carcinogenic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens), habit forming, causes antisocial behaviour, and can cause lethal withdrawal. [By some measures *heroin is safer than alcohol.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse#mediaviewer/File:HarmCausedByDrugsTable.svg) Yet people aren't out in the streets demanding alcohol prohibition (anymore). Indeed, its prohibition was a complete disaster. So there is clearly a disconnect here if we are looking at prohibiting some drugs based purely on objective data.  The thing is, *plenty of things we do in life are dangerous.* And we don't prohibit them because we're grown adults and we can do what we want. Belief in personal freedom is a huge component of Western morality, yet we maintain drug prohibition when there is objective evidence that not only does it not work but also that it exacerbates the problems we have with illegal drugs rather than mitigating them.  I agree with the OP, the only reason people object (mostly) to hard drug use is cultural conditioning. There is no rational reason. Legalize it, make it cheap and safe, and stop ostracizing the poor and vulnerable subset of society that chooses to do these things to excess.  One edit:   > It's also a hell of a lot easier to become a drain on society with cheap and abundant heroin than without it.  Heroin is already abundant. It's just not cheap. Reducing its cost to pennies a dose (or even providing it free) would turn a huge portion of our underclass from poor, antisocial, self-destructive fringe dwellers into simply self-destructive fringe dwellers. If you still want to look down on them morally for their choices that's up to you.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > When particular drugs have very statistically reliable effects on moral habits, then we have rational reason to forbid them.  I somewhat agree with this, but keep in mind the drug does not directly *cause* antisocial effects. It simply intoxicates the user and they nod off in a chair. We may condemn this behaviour as a \"waste of their life\", but it's arguably similar to sitting and watching TV or playing video games for hours on end, other activities that some people (i.e.: my parents' generation) consider a \"waste of their life.\" The true antisocial behaviours come from the addict trying to get more drug without the means, leading to the neglect of the normal parts of their life (work, housecleaning, proper food, etc) and theft, begging, etc. It could be argued that, say, methamphetamine would be a better candidate for prohibition since the behaviour of the individual *while on the drug* is more dangerous. Then again, a heavily drunk person can be just as problematic.  I simply argue that drug prohibition is akin to abstinence-only sex education: naive and ineffective at best, and at worst actually causing more problems than it solves.  My edit for your edit: :)  > Alcohol is legal because sufficiently many people wanted it legal, whilst being able to participate in democracy, to overturn a prohibition law. Heroin is not legal because there are fewer people who want it, and they are further from democratic enfranchisement, compared to those who don't do heroin and don't want to pay for the resulting medical emergencies and chronic issues.  Spot on. But I believe the medical emergencies/chronic issues of addicts could be enormously reduced by treating addiction as a medical, rather than criminal problem. The prevalence of hard drugs in maximum-security prisons attests to the fact that we will *never* make them disappear, no matter how hard the police crack down, so the best we can do is harm reduction.  As an aside, we appear to have sidetracked into Ye Olde Druge Prohibition debate instead of the moral issue the OP was talking about.\n",

In that case, your choices are no longer just impacting you.  As for your conscience?  If it doesn't bug you to cut in line, then it's ok to do so?

Now it did so for a host of historical contextual reasons, but it wasn't the only available choice nor was it in some way objectively best. It was just what was popular. That's the definition of arbitrary.   And if it wasn't for that arbitrary choice, then the option to even discuss what drugs we would like banned and which we would not want banned wouldn't be open to discussion. But the point is, just because something is an arbitrary decision doesn't mean it's a random decision or that it is a bad decision. It just means that other lines of reasoning would lead to other equally valid choices. Arbitrary is 'decided by one's liking, dependent upon will or pleasure; at the discretion or option of any one' (OED).  But simply because a choice is subjective (arbitrary) doesn't make it illogical.   Arbitrary choices can and are still logically supported.  At issue for reasonableness and logic in arbitrary choices is the question of if you shared the starting assumptions of those making the choice, would the choice made be a logically consistent outcome.

That particular study didn't look into it but it does refer to other survey data which only included drug users who used heroin at least 6 times. They did this to exclude experimental users. This survey showed that:  \"an estimated 71.2 percent of the daily heroin users reported having felt dependent on heroin. By comparison, an estimated 8.9 percent of the never daily users reported having had feelings of dependence on heroin. This difference in percentages from about 9 to 71 percent is consistent with presumed toxicity of nondaily heroin use versus daily heroin use.\" [Source] (http://ww1.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/92.pdf)  Basically, the people who used heroin every day had a high likelihood of feeling dependent, yes. Everyone else who used heroin less-than-daily but on 6 or more occasions had a very low likelihood of feeling dependent - so that 75% from before isn't just one or two-time users.

Maybe what I'm taking issue with is more your phrasing, which sounded like, 'If you do heroin, you are likely to become a junkie.' That isn't true.

You can look at [drug policy in Portugal](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal#Observations), which decriminalized *all* drugs in 2001, for evidence as to what the effects are of loosening drug laws. The Netherlands provides [heroin for free to addicts](https://news.vice.com/article/only-in-the-netherlands-do-addicts-complain-about-free-government-heroin) and it has had a massive public health benefit.

      "\t\t>>\t You're right about the alcohol, which is why we ban *drunk driving*, not drinking itself. Similarly we ban driving under *any* intoxicant or *any* intoxicated state. Being sleepy isn't illegal, but driving sleepy *is*. Getting drunk isn't, but beating your wife while drunk *is.* That's the distinction. I would argue people should not be driving or operating heavy machinery if they are impaired in any way at all, and I would suggest that being under the effects of *withdrawal* does not constitute proper sobriety.  Drugs may predispose towards certain behaviours (and they do), like sitting around while high on pot, fighting while drunk, or being a loud asshole while on cocaine, but, again, this is not reason enough to ban the drug. We expect people to behave appropriately in society and not break the \"big\" laws (i.e.: cause harm to others), and if they are unable to do so they should be encouraged to stop by their friends, family, or whatever. It is not the role of the state to prevent activities which \"predispose\" towards certain behaviours as there is no certainty that a crime will be committed.

My argument is that 1 in 4 is extremely addictive, especially when you take into consideration that this number is based on anyone who has ever tried heroin, *even once.*  From personal experience, it is definitely possible to only do heroin once, but if you go back to do it a second and third time, I feel your chances to get hooked grow exponentially higher.

I would say the reason people paint it in such a bad light is because once you are addicted, its an extremely ugly and painful process to get off of it.

Putting quotation marks around \"dangerous\" when referring to heroin is as callous as it is insulting. Have you ever met a heroin addict?

Of all the drugs, I'm not sure why you would even try to defend heroin  Let's put it in the context of [other drugs](http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&page=95) then. 23% of heroin users become dependent, 32% of tobacco users, 15% of alcohol users, 18% of cocaine users... the rates are pretty similar, smoking tobacco has just as high a mortality rate and can directly kill the people around you, alcohol is worse for your bodily health and also contributes to tens of thousands of cases of accidental injury/death, rape, and domestic violence every year.... But by popular belief, _heroin_ is the worst of the lot, nothing else even comes close.  Maybe you think overstating the risk is ok because it deters people from using it, how could that be a bad thing? I think that can be very bad. I think there is value in people understanding the true breadth and magnitude of the problem, both so that they can make informed decisions for themselves and for others. I think it's bad that people are so afraid of heroin that they won't even consider policies that could be construed as 'soft'. Decriminalized use, prescription heroin for addicts, syringe exchanges in many states, those options (though they have been shown to be effective at reducing the harms of abuse) are completely off the table because people are so afraid of it.

Your description implicitly reinforced those stereotypes, and I think that contributes to the harmful stigmas that are the subject of this thread.   Both times in the past that I have brought up the 25% figure on Reddit in the past, people have been very, very surprised and even disbelieving of it because it is so much lower than what they would have assumed.

The low percentage of people interviewed who have actually tried heroin, makes the percentage more powerful.  From such a small sample group and a quarter of them became addicted?  That is huge.  Also it is ignoring that alcohol and tobacco are sold cheaply and legally and alcohol is basically a cultural norm at this point.  The majority of people interviewed in that study had tried alcohol or cigarettes. If heroin was as socially accepted as cigarettes and alcohol, the percentage would go up.  Also one thing we haven't covered yet is the withdrawal process.  Heroin and cigarettes may be comparable in terms of addictiveness, but Heroin is harder to kick. Opioid withdrawal causes chills, cramps, sweating, diarrhea, nausea, anxiety, etc.  Nicotine withdrawal causes anxiety, difficulty in concentration and constipation.  Withdrawing from Heroin is a complete nightmare.   It is worth noting that heroin on its own (in proper non lethal doses) carries very little health risks.  It causes constipation and possibly some kidney damage, even after long term use. Heroin is feared as the big scary monster of the drug world, because it so hard to get off once you are addicted.   I don't believe in overstating any risks.  The risk of heroin speaks for itself.  For the record, I think most drugs should be legal and ALL drugs decriminalized... But thats why its so important not to downplay the destructive nature of Heroin.  It shouldn't be illegal anymore than rat poison is illegal, but it should handled with about as much care. \n",

Only 2% trying it doesn't make the 23% 'more powerful.' If anything, it does the opposite...  > If heroin was as socially accepted as cigarettes and alcohol, the percentage would go up.  If the number of heroin users changed so drastically that it included a significant portion of the population, the rate of dependency might change somewhat - but we would expect it to go down, not up. The reason is this: heroin is currently socially unacceptable and a very uncommon drug. The 2% who are doing it now _despite those social stigmas_ are probably more risk-taking, impulsive, antisocial, less health-conscious, etc than the average person. People with these traits are more likely to become dependent, so they bring the dependency rate up. That rate of dependency is basically selecting for people who are more likely to become drug-dependent than the average person.  Conversely, almost everyone has used alcohol. So the population of alcohol users not only includes the same types of anti-social risk-takers that use heroin, but also people with average and above average risk-aversion and impulse control. These people are less likely to become dependent so they bring the overall dependency rate of alcohol down -they compensate for the high-risk people.\n",

Well, let's get one thing straight: atheism is a lack of a belief in god(s) (an absence of 'theism') not an organisation, creed, code, community or dogma. It's not a system or a group of any kind - it's a label referring to people who do not hold a certain belief.

I'm neither very naturally interested in political issues, nor very intelligent at learning about or discussing them.

The issues which I *do* feel like debating and proselytising are ones I am more interested in, more knowledgeable on, and better at discussing.   So, essentially, I don't think anyone has a moral obligation to be a vocal defender or attacker of one position or another, simply because there are too many issues out there.

I say, \"You're stupid\" to people in a playful way all the time that communicates that they made me smile and probably laugh when they might have made a very intelligent joke or observation.  Words and terms change over time, they evolve to mean different things than the original/ literal interpretation.    Same thing here with \"You're gay\".

      "\t\t>>\t Honestly, it has never entered my head a single time while saying something is \"gay\" that it had anything to do with homosexuality *at the point of saying it*. I'm 24 and have used that term since childhood to display mild annoyance at something. Since my teens, and with a larger use of the internet, I have used the word \"faggot\" to express a stronger disdain for something or a joke towards someone I felt was acting like an idiot. Both of these words have become so far removed from their original meaning in my mind (and I'm willing to bet for other people) that they only retain the meaning of \"something that is bad\". While, yes, you could attach the \"something that is bad\" to homosexuals via mental connotation but the reality is that it's only ever when the subject OP has raised comes up that I ever think about it in those terms.   I understand that it's a hurtful word to some people but honestly that doesn't change my stance of using it to describe objects or people. It's intent that is important - much in the same way as someone calling me a \"Scottish bastard\" would be important if they did it with malice. My English friend calls me a \"jock cunt\" and a \"faggot\" all the time but it doesn't even slightly offend me, and I've called him a  \"faggot\" and a \"northern monkey\".   I tried to refrain from mentioning that he is bisexual but it's pertinent. However much the \"my best friends are gay/black/disabled/mentally ill\" example is used it doesn't stop it from being true and relevant *sometimes*. So here we have a person who has had sexual intercourse with men in the past who can not only use the word \"faggot\" (and more to the point the word \"gay\") but also hear it said towards him without taking offense because the intent is not to comment on his sexuality but to use the word in the more meaningful (to use at least) \"internet context\".   To that end I *would* be more hesitant to use \"faggot\" in real life because a larger proportion of the population has not been on the internet and would take it to mean what it originally did - my argument is that the words \"gay\" and \"faggot\" have different meanings now, to those with the \"right intent\" i.e. people who don't hold the LGB community as a lower class of citizen.   Frankly I welcome the fact that both of these words have become less barbed in their use. Using them both as a replacement for \"bad\" is far less destructive than using them to convey your complete distaste for gay people. Hopefully, the same will happen with the word \"nigger\" but that's a long way off.\n",
      "Identified toxic comment, ignoring...\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I kind of agree with this but you have to remember that \"gay\" has had different meanings throughout history. It originally meant you were joyous then some how it turned into a word to describe homosexuals. Many words that are considered to be \"bad\" words had different meanings at one point. When you call someone a dick or a cunt you don't actually think that person is genitalia. When I called someone gay when I was younger, did I actually think that person was a homosexual?  It is different when you call someone a derogatory word to their face such as faggot and queer. You are actually making an attempt to bully that person.  While calling someone gay jokingly hurts no one.  The real problem in my eyes is that we are too easily offended.\n",

For example, a friend might say \"Hey, wanna play video games at my house later?\" Another would reply with \"Yeah, we could watch a movie later too.\" Then a third friend might add \"Yeah, we could have an orgy later too.\" We would all say \"you're gay\" and have a laugh.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Agreed. I think in many cases it's hardly insulting, but still borderline out of bounds; it's usually still attaching a negative, or dismissive, connotation to being gay, or a personal attack if the person's not gay and being called so in a serious tone. The most positive context I can think of is picturing a [gabe](http://www.queerty.com/its-time-to-drop-fag-hag-and-start-using-gabe-gay-babe-20111203) (that's the first thing that came up with I googled 'pc word for a fag hag', and tbh: the girls are rarely babes in these situations) calling her friend 'so gay', and even that  almost always sounds patronizing as hell.

      "\t\t>>\t Yup, that's why it's an insult. It's bad to call a gay person straight and deny that they are gay too you know.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t You say it's intent that's important. But why would intent be more important than effect? Sure, if you call your buddy a faggot behind closed doors, no one is harmed and there's no real problem. But as a widespread phenomena, the world is full of a heck of a lot more people than your age group and social sphere or people with your sense of humour.  When a kid hears someone say \"gay\" or \"faggot\" as an insult, they know instinctually that it's a bad thing to be. And then maybe they hurl it at someone who actually is gay, because they've been steeped in the belief that gay is bad. Maybe it didn't happen around you, but it did and does happen to people our age group (I'm 24 too) and younger. All the fucking time. When a homophobe hears you call people faggots and gays, they think you're on their side. Their viewpoint is validated. When a person whose had faggot and gay used as a slur against them their whole lives hears you say it, they feel unsafe. So yeah, to you and your friends, and some other people too, it's taken on a new meaning. But to a lot of people (I would argue most people) it hasn't. Especially \"gay\". Like seriously, that word isn't going anywhere as a term for homosexual. So if your intent is good, why would you use \"gay\" to mean \"bad\"?  It's just a joke to you, but it's a lot more than that to a lot of people. Why would your joke and your good intentions be more important?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t How are gay people around you supposed to tell the difference between innocent you and not-innocent homophobes when you both use them as insults in the same way despite the intent behind being different?  We aren't mind readers. When a homophobe calls me a faggot, it sounds basically the same as when a \"friend\" calls me a faggot.  If I hear you calling your bisexual friend a faggot and saying \"that's gay\" I'm gonna assume you're prejudiced towards gay people, don't care how your words affect those around you, and are generally immature and intellectually lazy. I'm not a mind reader.  When you use the language of racists I'm gonna assume you're probably racist. Go around saying \"that's gay\" and \"faggot\" and I'm gonna assume you're probably a homophobe to some extent because the majority of time, when people call me a faggot or say \"that's gay\", they are homophobic and being insulting towards me.  I'm not a mind reader, and even if your mate if fine with it, at the very least you don't give a crap how your words affect other gay people around you who overhear them and who have been subjected to them throughout their life and have traumatic memories attached to them. You don't care what traumatic memories you might be causing, you don't care how annoying it can get for others having to hear it everywhere they go in life, you don't care if you're perpetuating dehumanisation and oppression *regardless* of your lack of  \"intent\" to do so  I honestly can't see why anyone would want to say \"faggot\" or \"that's gay\" when it makes you look like a intellectually deficient immature man child lol. It literally impresses nobody and doesn't make you look good in any way.

      "\t\t>>\t I think you're being intellectually dishonest. The reason it is an insult is that anyone called gay is supposed to feel bad about being called gay. The goal is the shame them into feeling inferior. Certainly the point here is that you shouldn't want to be the thing you are ebbing accused of. It's not as simple as being denied you're own identity. It is that but also suggesting you're the \"wrong\" identity.  No one goes around calling everyone they dislike straight. They call them gay. The point is to say \"you're the wrong sexuality\". Not simply that you've failed to live up to your own sexuality. But that there is a good one and a bad one and you're the bad one.  Think about where gay is most prominent as an insult: middle school. Kids in middle school are still trying to sort their sexuality out. It is unclear to many who and what they like. They don't yet have a strong sexuality present and yet every day they are being thrown insults that say to them \"you're gay. And gay is bad. You should feel bad about the idea that you might be gay\". But some of those kids are gay. They're being told \"you're supposed to be straight but your actually the bad sexuality. You're gay. Feel bad about that\". And guess what, many do. Suicide rates are much night for lgbt teens because, in part, they're told repeatedly their whole life that there is a wrong sexuality to have. And then they realize they have it.  \"That's so gay\" is not a simple matter of calling someone something they're not. You know this. It is obvious. Especially when it is primarily used on people who haven't yet sorted their sexuality. It is about shaming people into a heteronormativity that will never work for them. \n",

To be honest though, I haven't used \"gay\" to describe anything in quite a while - not sure why. At the end of the day, I'm not going to allow myself to either be censored because someone might find a word offensive, nor will I ever agree with anyone suggesting that I am somehow indirectly supporting bigotry by using a word in a way that has absolutely no relation to \"I hate you because you like men\". I do understand your point of view, I just don't agree with it.

The example was not meant to be an analogy to the gay statement. It was meant to show that something could be insulting regardless of the receiver of sender of the message, which you now seem to understand. > I do agree that implying that being gay is bad would be \"potentially\" insulting to gay people. Not \"potentially\", but \"definitely.\" It's definitely insulting to gay people to imply that being gay is bad. > I don't agree that using that particular phrase, \"That is gay\" actually comments on anyones sexuality a large portion of the time as the phrase has evolved to mean something else entirely. \"Gay\" still means \"homosexual\" so I'm not sure what you mean. Just because some people use it to mean \"stupid\" or \"bad\" doesn't change the fact that homosexual people still identify with the term. In fact, the fact that some people use it to mean \"stupid\" or \"bad\" - while knowing that it means \"homosexual\" - helps my point.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Actually, the feminist movement has always had notable friction among racial minorities in the movement. There are racial sub-groups, such as the black feminist movement, who ultimately believe in their understanding of what feminism is but know that the macromovement is ivory crafted and doesn't (and to some extent can't) meet the messaging and initiative needs that non-white feminists would like to see. Any feminist who has learned about the start of the movement and can take a critical look at the current movement from the perspective of those outside the movement should be able to tell you that the movement was and still is a movement seen to be spearheaded by mostly middle class white women (this a matter of the face of the movement as opposed to the actual composition of the movement). [Here's a brief synopsis of the rise of black feminism as an example.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_feminism#Latter_20th_century)  [The movement was also hostile to lesbians.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Menace#Origins) Then there is still some ongoing friction within the overall movement about where trans women fit in. Some historical outlines can be seen [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgenderism_and_transsexualism#Feminist_criticism) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgenderism_and_transsexualism#Feminist_exclusion_of_transgender_and_transsexual_people)  So saying that feminism \"is becoming openly hostile to minorities, particularly poor minorities\" is a misguided analysis of the movement because it lacks acknowledgment of the movement's past.

(This is true for the general users, but mostly not true for servers and routers, the big ass core routers and servers owned by ISPs and internet companies).    So, if I see an IP address, I can pin-point to a rough geographical area where the machine with that IP address may be located. Now, usually, people are connected to a NAT Box (popularly called 'routers'). This NAT Box has a public IP address and users connect to it over a private IP address. The IP address a public eavesdropper sees will be of this NAT Box.    Now, coming to TOR. TOR does route your traffic around to make it difficult to trace the source. But, someone with enough time can do it. Also, now that the FBI has it's own servers serving as TOR nodes, they can trace the original IP address a little more easily.    Another way to circumvent tracing is to use VPN. But that only works as long as your VPN provider is willing to stand up to the government.   So, this is why it is possible to pin-point that a device with a X.Y.Z.W IP address may be in this rough geographical area. TOR and VPN can make things difficult, but not impossible.\n",

The transition periods from cold to warm or warm to cold tend to involve massive ecosystem disruptions, with many plants and animals going extinct and others exploding in population as they enter ecosystems that lack natural predators or limits on their growth. A current climate change related example is the bark and spruce beetle infestations killing forests across the Mountain West and taiga regions of North America. These were formerly held in check by cold temperatures, but now the climate has warmed enough that they experience much lower winter mortality and in some areas can even have two generations in a single breeding season, where previously they could only manage one. For example, the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska has lost 70-80% of its spruce trees within the last ~20 years.

Just like the bans on thing like consuming shellfish and pork and having women speak in temples/churches, we can continue to set things aside as our understanding of the world broadens. It is now safe to consume shellfish and pork as well as beef and dairy touching. It no longer somehow aids our society to keep women from participating in certain things.

They might not be Christian but they need a common numbering system.   CE implies that *everyone* should consider the putative arrival of the Christian messiah as ushering in a new era for humanity. By saying that the Christian calendar is the \"common\" one, it's positioning Christianity as the default, the center, implying that everything else is niche or an aberration. \n",

They *don't* believe that Jesus was the Christ, so to go around saying \"Oh, but that was the year that the Christ came\" literally goes against everything they believe in.

It helps the reader understand the nature of the author and of the text. In the same way, using CE and BCE make the text sound  more academic.  Also, I don't see why you see this as anti-Christian. It feels a little persecution-complexy - we're still using the date scale precisely because it would be too much of  a hassle to switch over.

      "\t\t>>\t Actually I think OP is on to something.  Lets take three examples: Mickey Mouse, Elvis, and Animal Farm.  All of these were huge when they came out.  All of these were deserving of copyright protection.  Yet how do we decide when that protection should be evaporated?  Why not make one of the relevant factors a continued use of the copyright?  For example Disney is producing millions of mouse ear hats per year and using that little guy as a mascot like crazy.  Somehow, god knows how, kids today still know who he is and want to see him when they go to disney world.  So why on earth would we want that copyright protection to evaporate?    Animal farm on the otherhand is a tremendously important work but no one is going to be making a movie of it to preserve the copyright in it.  It is still probably selling a pretty good number of copies every year but at some point no one is still investing in it and it should pass to the public domain as the author has reaped the vast majority of the financial rewards that could be taken from his work.  Elvis is another good example.  Still a huge fan base and they should be able to keep churning out CDs, coffee mugs, etc.  But you can see that it is already getting a bit long in the tooth.  Kids today don't ask for trips to graceland, elvis did not turn into the next disney and we can see that ten, twenty, thirty years into the future no one is going to want to be reinvesting into the life of elvis for the sake of preserving a few tens of thousand a year in content sales.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > Somehow, god knows how, kids today still know who he is and want to see him when they go to disney world. So why on earth would we want that copyright protection to evaporate?  Because it's popular, therefore the public has an interest in it.   If it would evaporate, anyone could make *mouse ear hats* make MickeyMouse cartoons, and our pop-culture would be freer for it.   Copyright exists for our sake, not for Disney's. We give up part of our freedom and ability to copy, to sell, to produce, to sing, to watch, and even to create art,  so artists can have a stable revenue stream from monopolizing these options, and they can exist in an industry, and create more art *for us*.   The goal is not just to let them earn as much money as they can, but to let them earn as much money as absolutely necessery, before we can lift these monopolies and censorship restrictions from the public.   Do we, as a society, benefit from Disney making billions from old franchises, or we would be better off if after an initial theatre run, and a few years of merchandising (which easily profits several times over for anything but huge flops), it would be free for all others to have a go at it? \n",
      "\t\t>>\t >but my idea of it wouldn't consider that to count (and this would need to be reflected in the definition).  The biggest issue I see is that there is no way to appropriately make a legal definition for \"use\" of a copyrighted idea that would exclude derivative works, and as a result such valueless pieces of \"art\" would be churned out to meet the \"continued use\" requirements, and that these have negative value as \"art\"  >The copyrighted work itself would have to be made available, not just something based on it.   There are all sorts of issues with drawing the line, for instance is a \"purposefully\" bad rendition of the original idea (for sake of, say, parody or comedic purposes) legally distinguishable from a legitimately bad production? I guess you could say common sense, but then again with things like comedy, some old judge is definitely going to hold different views than, say, your average college student. Is there any way to actually write continued use laws to exclude such legitimately bad productions, while also not going overboard and crossing the brink of censorship?  >Or are you suggesting that all media would become low-budget and not as good because of this?  I don't think all media will succumb to this, but highly valuable properties certainly will. Say you're a company that holds the rights to Spiderman, and you personally don't have access to the writers/staff/whatever to make a really good Spiderman movie. Instead of giving it up to another company that could make one, you could just as easily make a really *bad* Spiderman movie that they can still make a slight profit off of (because it's Spiderman) so that a) other companies don't make money and b) if they ever do get the rights, it now has a negative rep in the public's eye, making it less valuable   Ultimately I think it's better that we let certain ideas remain unused, than create restrictions that would only encourage the production of meaningless movies/shows, which is what I believe to be the inevitable fate of \"continued use\" provisions\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I would argue that we benefit, as a society, from Disney retaining its copyright over Mickey Mouse - and Mickey is a perfect example because he is nothing except what Disney put into him.  That mouse is a symbol of the corporation.  he doesn't have a personality, he doesn't have a back story, he doesn't have any depth except as a symbol promoted and advertised like a trademark.  Sure they might toss that mouse into video games, or children's cartoons, etc. but there isn't a character to speak of.  If we did pull the copyright would people suddenly spring up to turn him into a fleshed out character?  No - you might as well start with your own character as using him wouldn't save you any work.  What it would do is cause an economic disruption to the Disney corporation, reduce its profitability, and force it to pour money into a new symbol that it would now have to worry about expiring with time as well.  We would be destroying Disney's goodwill without creating anything in turn.  Who would benefit by putting Mickey in the public domain?  I am sure there are a lot of people out there who are eager to put him into pornography as a way of both shocking people's sensibilities (specifically because he is such a recognized symbol), and shitty warehouse owners eager to make a few bucks stamping out cheap, crappy, mouse ears.  Why on earth should be be helping those people?  Yes copyright's origin is providing content creators, and their families, a stream of income from the fruits of their work during their lifetimes, but surely if a piece of IP is still producing huge revenues close to a hundred years on we are dealing with something outside of that view that is also worth protecting.    I acknowledge there really is a conflict between what you are suggesting, art as a conversation that requires dynamic contribution by different voices for the benefit of all, and profiting from IP you created.  But if I wanted to actually contribute something to the public, some smart commentary I had about Mickey Mouse, I could do it in different ways.  I can make Road Runner without the road runner being Mickey Mouse.  I can make spaceballs without apropriating the star wars name.  I can make fifty shades of grey without appropriating twilight. Heck it is actually really rare for someone to take a public domain work and really do something of public merit with it.  What public domain really does is stop us from having to figure out who owns, and how much they should be paid, every single little piece of media that is ancient.  That is a hugely useful function in this day and age but no one is out there trying to remake the vast, vast, majority of old public domain works.    Where there are exceptions to this the new author is creating their own value as opposed to just appropriating it.  You want to make a Dracula movie, a From the Earth to the Moon remake, a Pride and Prejudice Series you had better be bringing something new and wonderful to the table or it is going to flop and you will lose a bunch of money.  The simple fact that Pride and Prejudice is being remade isn't automatically going to turn out crowds - you have to market, you have to show people you got something good for them. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t > I would argue that we benefit, as a society, from Disney retaining its copyright over Mickey Mouse - and Mickey is a perfect example because he is nothing except what Disney put into him.  Actually, that makes it a pretty bad example of copyrights, because you are really talking about trademarks.   Not Mickey Mouse as a work of fiction, but Mickey Mouse as a logo like the Golden Arches, or the Apple, or the Pepsi Globe. That has *nothing* to do with creative work or ownership of original ideas, that's about businesses not being allowed to fake an identification where certain shapes would clearly imply one.   > But if I wanted to actually contribute something to the public, some smart commentary I had about Mickey Mouse, I could do it in different ways. I can make Road Runner without the road runner being Mickey Mouse.  So what? Just because there is a silver lining to censorship, that at least artists can always create something else, (that might be even more original), that doesn't mean that censorship is an entirely neutral or good thing, it's still messing with artists to protect others.   When the Hayes Code banned sex and violence in movies, that led to the rise of the bible epic genre, since those were still allowed to be violent and sexy as long as they followed the gcripture. Great classics, like The Ten Commandments, and Ben-Hur, were born that way.   This doesn't mean that the Hayes Code was a great thing, it was still petty censorship, and competent artists could have just as easily created something great *without it*.   Just because the public is forbidden from making a Mickey Mouse cartoon, or a Star Wars movie, or write a Narnia novel, doesn't mean that what they do instead of it is any better. Just look at 50 Shades. Being forced to search&replace some character names didn't make it any better, meanwhile there are plenty of talented creators who have shown their ability to tell great stories in licensed or public domain universes.   I would rather have them be free to do more like that, whwn that feels appropriate than forbid them to create certain types o art, for their own good.   > Heck it is actually really rare for someone to take a public domain work and really do something of public merit with it.  I can still think of plenty. J. M. Coetzee's Foe, Margaret Atwood's Penelopiad,  Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Alan Moore's League of the Extraordinary Gentlemen, Disney's animated canon (most of it), and these are just some of the highest unquestionable reputation,  there are also the regular decent works that are roughly as good as all the other IPs of the same calibre.   > Where there are exceptions to this the new author is creating their own value as opposed to just appropriating it. You want to make a Dracula movie, a From the Earth to the Moon remake, a Pride and Prejudice Series you had better be bringing something new and wonderful to the table or it is going to flop and you will lose a bunch of money.  But that dynamic could also be expanded to much younger works, if only they were Public Domain.   Maybe there are so few public domain based works, because by necessity they are all forced to be period pieces, which is a single niche. Cut copyright back to the original 28 years, and you would see the same principle apply to Superman, Star Wars, Spiderman, Lord of the Rings, etc. Right now, we are getting their sequels up the wazoo, because as long as a single company owns them, they all serve as little monopolies, edges that they can use to undercut each other, by holding our yearly doses of them.   If Star Wars would be as public domain as Pride and Prejudice, then (at least after the few years of moronic gold rush),  a status quo would set up where Star Wars is not a scarce, valuable franchise, since anyone can use it, it's just an important milestone of 20th century pop culture, that is only interesting by it's transformation.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Ok so there are 2 reasons I said my predicted scenario is likely. Going back to the Spiderman example, there are 2 reasons a company may produce a derivative work if they see the property to be valuable enough to keep others from using it: >a) other companies don't make money and b) if they ever do get the rights, it now has a negative rep in the public's eye, making it less valuable  I'll add to that: c) if a company can produce a movie that is of actual low quality, but still very profitable (like a scaled down Michael Bay summer blockbuster) they can not only use that fulfill continued use requirements but also use it to market other products, like toys and such. Even if they barely break even on the film, profit from other sources might be enough to make such an act worthwile  So here are 3 potential motives for a company to make a derivative work instead of letting it go to the public.  In response to your side note, I don't think any proposed solution could be achieved that current copyright holders would find agreeable (as they would inevitably be on the losing end of such an agreement). Also, I think the only real solution would be to either 1) drastically decrease the length one can hold a copyright, or 2) condition copyright claims not on continued \"use\" but on continued investment of *financial resources* with respect to the company's financial assets. Neither idea is fleshed out at all, but I can think about it more if you'd like  (also, it might take a while for my next response, so sorry about that in advance)\n",

If you start by modeling the earth as flat, you can still effectively navigate short distances. For slightly longer distances, you can just add correction terms to explain discrepancies.

I'm sorry but your initial assumptions on how economists view markets are just wrong. I've explicitly detailed how and why for you in my previous post. As such, the premise that economists are starting off by modeling with knowledge akin to \"the earth as flat\" as their starting premise is simply faulty.  >The fact is, it takes more work to do it. It take more time, it takes better paid economists, so it happens with less frequency than the application of a simpler framework.  Again, it works the other way around. Economic research that is not utilizing as inclusive and extensive modeling as possible to account for as many variables are often too simply and thus dismissed in economic theory.  The leading schools of thought and economic theory are backed with extensive and far-reaching math.   That's like saying because the math is harder to do, physics is dominated by theories using simple mathematics and elementary modeling. That's just untrue. While simpler modeling is easier to do in both fields, they're taken less seriously.  >I agree, it has an effect. Sometimes it's the primary effect. But, when you have to correct the math for every little cost that comes up, you're never going to be able to take it all into account.  The consequence of economic modeling is that some variables will inevitably be left out. They cannot all be considered. That is impossible to do. That is why economists try to capture as much of them as possible. You won't get a 100% accurate replication of the real world. That is, again, impossible.

I don't think any men are fighting for the right to make a woman's stomach not bloated. They are fighting for the option to not be attached to a child that is granted to women.   Let's say a man and a woman have sex and the woman gets pregnant. If she doesn't want to birth a child she can abort it, if she doesn't want to have a child she can give it up for adoption; either way a year after the pregnancy it's like it never happened, it's just a memory with no implications on the present. The man in this situation has no options. If the woman aborts it, that was her right and the baby is gone, I don't know of anyone who argues for forcing a woman to birth a baby. That point is not fought.   The key point is here though, what if the woman decides to keep the baby. The woman exercised her right to birth a baby and has chosen to keep it. The man had no say in the baby's birth (which is fair) but ALSO has no choice in if the baby is kept. He is obligated to pay child support and has no option not to. The woman has the option to avoid parenthood with adoption services but the man gets his option picked for him by the woman's choice.

What would you say to the argument that the man should be financially responsible for a fair proportion of the extra expenses that arise due to the pregnancy, but could still be off the hook after the child is born?  And to keep things simple, we'll assume that the woman knew that the man didn't want a child before they had sex, that he took reasonable precautions against it happening, and that he had no reason to believe that the woman would keep the baby if she did get pregnant.  There doesn't even need to be any deception - she could have just changed her mind after she was pregnant.  Basically this is something that she wants, something that he didn't want, something that she knew he didn't want, and something that he had no idea  she wanted.  That way there's at best a *very* weak argument that the man tacitly agreed to being financially liable for the child's lifetime.\n",

It is unjust for the law to force men to pay for kids when they were raped.  It is unjust for the law to force **boys** to pay for kids when they were raped.  It is unjust for the law to force men to pay for kids that resulted by deliberate deception.  The law must be just. And that is why financial abortion should be legal.\n",

In case 2 I would argue that if the women goes ahead with keeping a child that the man specifically DOESNT want, the man should be clear of any financial responsibility. Some other people have argued that the situation for women is unfair because they actually have to carry the child and the biology of the situation. That's assuming they waited to have the child. If a woman goes through with an entire pregnancy and doesn't abort her child then SHE made the decision to have that child, not the man. Women know the outcome of sex just as much as men, sometimes they result in babies, why a man has to pay for a child he doesnt want doesnt make sense to me. We havent even discussed the very real situation in many households where the women are currently the breadwinners and make substantially more money than their S.O. Many women abuse this system and try to get pregnant with wealthy men in illegitimate situations to abuse this law. I would have to add though that the one reason i feel the status quo is fair is the fact that we have a lot of fucked up places in america where a poor disenfranchised women wont have adequate access to a safe abortion option, in that case the baby is coming whether you like it or not, and i do feel the guy has to cough up the cash in that sad and unfortunate situation.  Case 3 i feel is even more important. The emotional toll it would have to be in love with a women, hear that she has conceived your child, and then hear immediately that she doesnt feel like shes ready and wants to get rid of it, can be extremely traumatic for a lot of men. There was a story about it on relationships a while ago that just broke my heart. The girl basically told the dude (im paraphrasing) \"you're a great guy, but im not exactly head over heels for you. i just dont feel that way and I'm going to take care of it.\" True, its only a collection of few generic cells, this isnt a pro life pro choice discussion, but that doesnt change the fact that a lot of guys view this as a very personal and damaging situation to be in.

      "\t\t>>\t Would you support a law that penalized pregnant women who failed to undergo abortion if their partner died early into their pregnancy, or pregnant women who failed to undergo abortion when their partner was known to be inaccessible for the purposes of child support?  Unless you support that statement in its entirety, you're accepting that it is morally and legally acceptable for someone to bring a child into the world with the understanding that the child will not have the resources and benefits associated with having two parents.  Given that this is acceptable, it's illogical to accept that a mother is not free to make the same choice in a case where the father is theoretically available but has preemptively disowned the child; in doing so, you must by nature validate the father's decision to do so.  To illustrate the point, if you accepted the first statement as true, you would have to accept that a woman who failed to undergo abortion despite the knowledge that her male partner would be unavailable to provide support for the child (regardless of why) would *herself* be engaging in an act that should rightly be punishable by law.  The wording's convoluted, I know, so it may take a couple tries, but it does make sense.  (I'm not calling you stupid, I'm calling my wording awkward.)  Basically, either it's acceptable for someone to unilaterally decide that a child will come into the world with only one parent or it isn't.  If it isn't, you have to throw the book at not just voluntary single mothers, but widows as well.  If it is, that decision cannot be meaningfully divided by gender, especially because a woman has the option of abortion in response to such a decision by her partner.  Justice is allowing both men and women to make an affirmative choice whether to become parents based on the limitations implied by their biology.  There is no justice in allowing women the right to abortion while holding men legally responsible for a decision they had no part in making.

That's not fair either.  While it's impossible to make this whole uncomfortable situation fully fair for everyone, a man being able to financially dissolve his ties to the child (with, perhaps, some compensatory requirement to attempt to legally make up the difference you rightly bring up) is far more fair than the current situation where a woman's choice to have or not have a baby has decades of financial consequences for the father that he has no control over.\n",

For all intents and purposes, a man using some form of legal abortion is undergoing the *exact same process* as one who (with his partner) decides to place a child for adoption; the only difference is that the resulting child is \"adopted\" by the biological mother (should she herself choose neither abortion nor adoption) rather than an unrelated party.\n",

The implication that he would necessarily be able to just walk away the morning after is false, they are both responsible for the pregnancy.

The woman has opted for *and completed* an abortion.  2. The woman has opted for adoption, *has carried the baby to term, and the adoption is complete.*  3. The woman has opted to keep and raise the baby *and has carried the baby to term.*  Note that there is also no reason why a woman might not opt out as well, yet carry to term and let the baby be raised by the man if she doesn't want to and he does.

      "\t\t>>\t Not guaranteed,  by written law.  However,  judges, unless complete idiots,  would never grant custody, even partial,  to a rapist.   Many states do have specific laws revoking custody from rapists.  However I'm pretty sure those require a conviction.   Though frankly, as the law sits,  they're not a rapist if not found guilty.     The problems with custody and child support involving \"rape\" where the offender is granted parental rights of support or custody,  isn't actual rape but statutory rape,  these cases are under a slightly different color of law,  as the offender and victim are not necessarily risk laden when it comes to the welfare of the child.  Even though if convicted they'd likely dissolve any parental rights anyhow.   Ultimately this particular matter isn't one of regular concern,  or even of minor concern.   At very worst,  the rape victim will have to fight the custody in court, which can be a pain in the ass,  plus a traumatic bit considering their rapist is the plaintiff.   But to be actually awarded custody for their efforts,  I'm not sure a case as such even exists in the US (statutory rape excluded) and if it does, it's exceedingly rare.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t >Abortion is not always an available option for women.   The number of women for whom abortion is not a *medical* option is very small.  The availability of abortion as a *practical* option (due to cost or location issues, for example) is an issue of execution rather than morality or legality.  The solution to issues with abortion availability is not arbitrarily depriving all men of reproductive autonomy, it's fixing issues related to abortion availability.  >And even when it is, abortion affects a woman in ways that it does not and can not affect men.  Absolutely, but what does this have to do with the argument or point at hand?  Fundamentally, the existence of abortion means that women do *not* necessarily have to carry a pregnancy to term, let alone give birth and then take legal/financial responsibility for the resulting child.  Which are closer, abortion and legal/paper/financial abortion or abortion and forced legal/biological parenthood?  It isn't really a complicated question, and as far as legal fairness (and justice, for that matter) are concerned it makes sense for us to opt for the more analogous of the two.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t But to be fair, the alternative is carrying the child to term which can also affect the woman in ways that does not and cannot affect men. Also, adoption is an alternative that would involve the same degree of stress and pain as if you kept the child for yourself (although obviously not exactly the same since you go through all that stress and pain for nothing; since the child is given away).  Also of note is that early-pregnancy abortion is a very safe and practical for most women (of note is the regional differences -- in my area, abortion is freely available and doesn't even require parental consent). The early-pregnancy options are arguably easier, safer, and less painful than carrying the child to term.  Admittedly, there's the emotional issue as well, which I admit I do not really consider (this is a moral issue and I do not really have any attachment to unborn children). However, I see this as a trade off. You can have the child if you really want, but you can't expect someone else to pay for them.  And it's not like it's the only moral issue where you have to make such kinds of trade offs. What if the father had died? You still have the same question of whether or not to raise the child, but this time you most certainly will not be getting child support (at least I don't think you can get child support from the dead -- if so, change this hypothetical scenario to the father also being broke).  As an aside, if we're going to consider the moral issue here, we should consider it the other way around, too. What if the mother doesn't want the child but the father does? He's not in a position to get the child (I don't think any rational person would argue that the woman should be forced to carry the child to term). Yet, if he's morally against abortion or similar, then he might be affected by the abortion in ways that the woman does not!\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Good point. Usually happens for existing children, though, since if a woman gets pregnant and doesn't want the child, an abortion is entirely her choice and no court system can say otherwise (at least in my country).  In fact, I do not argue against child support for existing children; only for the case of an unborn child.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well it's not a case of playing draw, but more to the point:    - once conceptions occurs, she is either pregnant for 9 months or has to go through a medical abortion procedure.  She can't just \"wish it hadn't happened\" and sign a paper and walk out.   - both pregnancy and abortion are psychological as well as physical burdens.   - if the child is born, she can't opt out of child support.    The only choice the female has that the male does not is pregnancy vs. abortion ONLY because pregnancy happens in her body.  A female cannot choose on another woman's body nor can the female choose that the male be pregnant instead.  \n",

A financial abortion would mean eliminating all parental rights. Just as people who adopt out their kids lose parental rights.  It would make no sense for someone who enacts financial abortion to have any parental rights whatsoever.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Regarding the restraining order thing, I would think that would be unnecessary. Surely the kind of person who financially aborts has no interest in being a father.  A restraining order just create issues and complicates what would otherwise be a very simple process. For example, consider the case of someone who has sex with someone, financially aborts, and then in a few years, has children of his own. His children could end up going to the same school as the kid he has a restraining order against, which obviously causes issues.  Besides, what would we need a restraining order for? The guy is not a threat or anything. He just doesn't want to pay for the kid. That's not what restraining orders are for.  If the guy ends up being a crazy stalker, sure, get a restraining order then, but that's completely unrelated from the fact that he financially aborted.  Of course, there's the issue of when the father \"financially aborts\" but stays with the family (ie, just saying that he doesn't want to pay child support if he ever leaves) which could be handled in the same way that we already do: child support is dependent on whether or not you support the child. It's not automatically given and would have to be requested if either parent decides to stop supporting the child. And presumably if the family gets back together, the child support payments would stop. This requires a court system with some discretion, which seems like a challenge (okay, that was a bit snarky, but we can't deny that the courts can be extremely inconsistent), but not unbelievable.  As an aside, a complete alternative could be to use basic income here. You may be familiar with that (if not, checkout /r/basicincome). It usually covers adults, but could easily cover children, too. The children's pay could be given to the parents until they child becomes an adult and could be appropriately chosen so that it's always enough to raise the child. I don't consider people having many children to get money to be an issue since child support already exists and the basic income would only be enough to raise a child and not significantly such that you could become rich from it.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Yes, it'd be a much bigger hassle... And where would this money come from, to take care of all these kids? I can already hear the righteous anger of taxpayers having to fund these slutty mothers' drinking/drug/gambling habits along with their bastard brats. Note that most of the flak will be on the mother in this situation, because the father is absent and virtually impossible to ID or point fingers at.  Not to mention that now that there's virtually no repercussion for impregnating a woman (because there's no way in *hell* the gov't is all powerful enough to monitor the father's every move), why not impregnate another woman?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Agreed, but by that logic, both should be held responsible because the pregnancy was a result of both parties' actions.  The problem arises when only one has a say in the matter.  Edit: Otherwise, you'd either have to argue that women are entirely responsible for what happens to their bodies (and men aren't responsible for what they do to them), thus allowing men to financially abort, or that men are entirely responsible for what they do to women's bodies (and women aren't responsible for what happens to theirs), giving them no decision.  Each of those options operate on a complete lack of agency on one side, making it difficult to find a middle ground when both parties are held accountable for their actions.\n",

There are lots of business agreements that are illegal even if everyone involved agrees to them. Suicide pacts and assassin for hire is just the tip of the iceburg. Prostitution is another. Any kind of forced labor or slavery is the third.If you agree to do work and then refuse to do it, the other guy is entitled to compensation, but they can't expect a cop to come over and force you to dig that ditch at gunpoint just because you signed an agreement. You are also not allowed to sell your organs or kids. You can't enter into a sale of goods for the purposes of tax evasion. I could go on and on. Lots of people have signed business agreements against their will. A LOT of landholders have been forced to sell their property due to developers forcing them to do so, for example.  >No one can be forced into employment against their will, that would be illegal. If however, they sign a contract agreeing to, the law will hold them to the terms of that agreement (assuming those terms are within the existing law).  Now this is a much more accurate statement. You should have skipped the first one in favor of this. It's a much stronger point.  Here is the thing - the law does not consider money to be the same as physical labor. It hasn't since the days when slavery was legal. You cannot force anyone to do something they don't want to do under the law. You can force them to pay compensation, yes. Many people would rather do the work than pay the compensation, yes.  But you cannot force someone to use their body to do something they don't want to do in the non-criminal sphere. Not in any first world country anyway. This includes giving birth or having an abortion.  A cop will not follow you on stage and force you to sing words, no matter how many lawyers Sony has. They won't drag you into an abortion clinic against your will. All they will do is make sure you pay any compensation that a court orders for business agreements.  That's one of the issues here - you cannot equate forcing someone to give birth to forcing someone to pay fees. Any attempt to do so will and should fail.  Now, there ARE ways to approach this problem where you are not putting personal freedom up against financial freedom, and instead pitting financial obligations of two parties against each other. These arguments are the ones to go with, and have more support within both the legal and legislative communities.\n",

(i.e. a large enough life insurance policy, survivor's benefits/pension etc.)  Either way, you're sidestepping the main point: if children have a \"right\" to the support of two parents, it's reasonable to punish *any* parent who makes an affirmative decision to create or keep a child in a situation where the child will be deprived of that right.  This is ridiculous, of course, but if it isn't true we basically have to accept that it is morally and legally acceptable for a parent to unilaterally place a child in a position where they will be deprived of one parent's support.  If that's true, it's actually *easier* to justify the male equivalent from a moral perspective, since a man preemptively disclaiming parenthood is much more likely to lead to an abortion (and no child to be deprived of anything) than a woman voluntarily becoming a single parent (which effectively guarantees it).  It's an unusual approach to the argument, but it's not necessarily an invalid one.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t As the other guy mentioned, those specific situations aren't excluded (the logic is supposed to be that child support is for the child's benefit and not the mother, but theory doesn't always translate well into practice).  But even if we did just allow those two situations, I would still argue that the general idea (always being able to financially abort) should be an option. This really comes down to the fact that I believe nobody should have a child that they cannot afford. It's rational to not have a child (or want to abort if accidental pregnancy occurs) when money is tight. A law that forces otherwise goes against the original intent of the people having sex (I'm presuming that people who have sex do not want a child unless they discuss and agree before hand).  Further, requiring child support payments could be viewed as damaging to the payee. It's a major expense that can financially cripple those who don't have a lot of extra cash (which is quite a lot of people). Especially if you get thrown in prison if you can't make the payment *yet still have to make future payments* (despite prison obviously ruining your finances even more).  However, I should note that I'm referring solely to cases where the an unwanted pregnancy occurs and not cases where a family with existing children separates (which is very different).  There's also the case of when the father is not informed until after the birth or if the father cannot be found. It's my opinion that in those cases, the father would be absolved from paying child support (unless they want to, but that's something for them to do personally and not a court matter). This is because if finances are an issue, the woman always has the power to abort or put the child up for adoption.  As you can tell, I have very strong views against having children that you're knowingly not financially able to support. This is a utilitarian view that won't be popular with many, but I believe to be very rational and maximizes economical fairness.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t It depends on the state. Boys who have been the victim of statutory rape have had to pay child support.

      "\t\t>>\t Which would involve the mother putting together paperwork, documenting the illegal visits with as much evidence as possible for proof- it would have to be multiple visits, for a strong case- and then most likely lawyering up to actually produce repercussions.   If the guy's rich (and he'll likely be better off than mom, seeing as he isn't bringing up a kid), he may be able to line up a good defense attorney and maybe even win visitation rights to see the kid he wanted to abort.   The problem with this idea is that it places the burden on the mothers doorstep: first in taking care of the kid, and second in keeping the father away. All of this documenting, the court visits, and lawyer would cost women time, money, and effort to fight. Most people have enough difficulty investing their time, money, and effort in things that they *want* and are vital to *life*. Why make these ladies lives harder just to give men a \"get out of irresponsible sex free\" card?  Edit: I also want to clarify for you why women might decide to keep a kid even if they are in no way capable of raising one.   First off, there's a huge societal pressure to not abort- some families will straight up disinherit/have nothing to do with their daughters if they do so.   Second, it's not that easy to abort. In quite a few states, the doctors are legally required to do a little \"shaming speech\" about how far a long the kid is: whether or not the fetus will be able to feel pain, what features have developed, etc. This is an attempt to humanize the fetus, and make it feel more like murder.   Third is the access issue. Due to highly stringent regulations on facilities, in many states there are no more than a few facilities. This means that a woman has to drive several hours, or possibly fly to a different state, to get the procedure done. And I hope you realize that there would definitely have to be more than one visit before the abortion, and that the entire cost will be on the woman (insurers don't have to cover abortions).  Fourth is the health issue. A lot of men seem to think that abortion is easy and easily accessible (it isn't), without recognizing the potential health hazards for women. If it's done wrong, women can be seriously hurt. They can also become sterile, even plan b can fuck with your body if you use it too often. It's suggested to never take it more than twice.  And all of this ignores the massive potential for shaming on the way to a clinic: there are a number of facilities that bill themselves as abortion clinics, but in fact wait until the woman is vulnerable (re: undressed and in scrubs for their visit), and then verbally lambaste them for their choice. They can't leave, because the facility is keeping their clothes hostage. Some women walk out without their clothes in public just to escape.  Then there are the protesters who are routinely in front of the real facilities. And then, there's the fact that insurance providers also like to make birth control as hard as possible to get in the first place. When my sister recently went to pick up her birth control, they denied her first because she didn't have her prescription card, even though she had her insurance card. Then, when she provided her prescription card, her insurance provider insisted on having written notice from her doctor for the prescription, even though the doctor called the prescription in to the pharmacy for her in the first place.  Women already have all of these shitty impositions, now you want to place another shitty imposition on women where they're forced to be solely responsible for the kid? Do you guys really think women should universally be put between a rock and a hard place for all things related to sex?! Do men *want* to get laid?\n",

There are lots of people who claim they don't have to pay taxes because they never agreed to (ie \"freemen\"), and it just plain doesn't work. You can't boil a social issue down to simple contract law. If you could, slavery would still be legal.  If the law says you have a legal obligation to support your offspring, then you do. Don't like it, fix the law. But you can't pretend the law doesn't exist when it's inconvenient.  Contracts are ONLY enforceable if society chooses to enforce them, and ONLY on the terms society deems appropriate. That's why a contract that *should* be valid, like an agreement between a prostitute and her customer, is not enforceable in areas where prostitution is illegal, and a contract to marry off a 9 year old is perfectly valid and enforceable in some jurisdictions even though it should not be.   **Contracts are not magical.** They have no power other than what society says they have. And society cares more about children's rights than and adults rights because adults have more options and choices than kids. To you, it's a support payment, to a kid, it's survival. Again, don't like it, change it. But that's the current state of affairs.  Here is the thing. Society has a responsibility to make sure that children are taken care of. Every politician ever elected will tell you that one of their platforms was the protection of the innocent. It's not up for debate.  The real question is, who should pay? Me, as a taxpayer? I didn't didn't get anyone pregnant. Even if a guy was fraudulently made a father, he STILL has more of a connection to the child than I do. Than anyone does.  Is that fair? No. Is it more unfair than creating a system where anyone could abandon a child at anytime for any reason? No. And that's where we are: the lessor of 2 evils.  It's not about fairness. It's about choosing a lesser wrong over a greater one. The father might feel innocent in all this, but the kid is even more innocent. Pure and simple. I know this because I asked the same question in law school and got the same answer from someone who was not only a law prof, but also a family court judge.  Bottom line, legally, you are responsible for the results of your actions. And even when you are not responsible for your actions due to drunkeness or fraud, they were STILL your actions, not some random strangers. You are more closely connected than a random stranger on the other side of the country. Therefore it's more fair to dump the problem on you than them.  **Where things are not fair is that men and women are currently held to different levels of responsibility.** That's the real crux of the issue. Arguing contract law creates a very weak position. It's just plain a bad argument. There are better ones to use.  **The real issue is the difference in obligations between men and women, and the lack of consequences for misbehavior resulting in a child. That's not contract law**. Bringing in contract law just weakens any arguments you may have. Never use contract law if you have any other option. It's almost always the weakest argument.\n",

That's probably part of why there's a discrepancy between the woman being allowed to abort and the man not being able to give up financial responsibility - the woman is aborting something that is still a part of her body, ergo not a socially independent entity, whereas the man is \"aborting\" a new member of society, a real person. That carries many more problems for society, which now has to care for this real person by providing the education, healthcare, housing, etc that its birth father refused it. Conversely, only the biological mother has to care for her foetus (outside of any state abortion funding, which may be in place because it's cheaper to pay for abortions than to pay for unwanted babies). If that is indeed the rationale, then I don't see financial abortion ever becoming a thing. I'm pulling this together from my background knowledge only, but considering that most of developed countries' birth rate comes from the lower classes, where alimony payments would be a strain on the father (add class-specific issues with marriage rates and parental abandonment rates, racial and ethnic specifics), giving fathers the option to give up their children financially would put an unconscionable strain on the state budget.

      "\t\t>>\t I'm sorry for instigating the long comment. I'm not trying to flame you, I'm trying to argue against your argument. Someone brought up contract law and you stated that breaking a contract will make someone responsible for compensation. My argument was simply that the compensation analogy is a bad foot to stand on, as you might agree since you said drawing an analogy between contract law and abortion is a poor choice.   If people started assuming what obligations fall under sex, we might not have legal abortions now. A common argument against abortion was that women decided to take on their responsibilities as an adult when they had sex, and it certainly isn't the fetus' fault that it's alive. It doesn't choose to attach itself, it's forced there by it's parents. The law supported this idea for a very long time, and it was eventually changed by long debates and spreading information to gain support.  This debate is similar. The current law should be changed if it is considered unfit by a large portion of the population. At least, a large enough portion to consider a compromise. I'm not trying to evade the law, I'm trying to keep the law from making assumptions about my obligations after I've consented to sex, which is a similar thinking to what led to legalizing abortions. This debate supports opening the law to more freedom and less responsibility.  Naturally, you get people who support freedom for themselves and people who support responsibility for others, especially when there is something to gain. I get flustered by these debates when I see \"Men entered the contract and must assume responsibility.\" used when the same was not considered true of women, and was even considered an irrational, misogynistic argument. I get really bothered by the \"Biology is unfair, get over it.\" argument because that was a very central attack on women not very long ago. These kinds of arguments support giving up on the search for a better approach since, as you stated, the best we can do is choose between two evils.  I suggest that, if we've already shown that the arguments used against abortion have no basis in reasoning, we should not use the same arguments to justify an unchanging law. Instead, we should be finding a much deeper understanding of how to sort out the responsibilities of being an adult in the most unbiased way possible so that oppression/sexism/whatever else can be written out of federal laws. \n",

Broken down, one argument says, \"It's unfortunate that you're the one who happens to get pregnant, but we're both equally responsible for our actions and therefore have earned an equal say in the matter because it will affect both of us.\"  The other says, \"We're both equally responsible for our actions, but you voided your right to determine those responsibilities upon having sex because I'm the one who happens to get pregnant.\"  I'm trying to play devil's advocate for both sides, but it's like placing a monetary value on the physical burden of pregnancy.  If humans mated like fish, we'd have an equal say in the matter, but like you said, abortion gives a woman autonomy over her body, even though the man is affected as well.

Historically, women had it bad - real bad. I've read a lot of court cases and they are enough to make anyone from the modern era really mad. That's a problem of course, because in correcting a legitimately bad circumstance, another bad circumstance was created.   >Instead, we should be finding a much deeper understanding of how to sort out the responsibilities of being an adult in the most unbiased way possible so that oppression/sexism/whatever else can be written out of federal laws.

It took one generation for the Canadian preferences to take hold in my family.

It is interesting to me that Disney almost always plays on that romantic angle (as does nearly every thing that comes out of Hollywood), whereas stories from Studio Ghibli in Japan (Hiyao Miazaki films) do not at all.

I want to point out that there is a good chance that neither Julian nor Ricky was taking home a paycheck that was anywhere near to your level of pay.  I don't know if knowing that would settle your mind or accept the situation any more than you already have.  The same government programs that facilitate getting people jobs like this also have provisions where the pay rate is literally in the slave labor zone.  This is because the job is not meant to support them fully, but is meant to keep them socially integrated into society versus locked away at home alone/with only their immediate caregivers.  The job duties and pay are a far and much less emphasized second goal in this whole concept.  Now this may sound like I have an axe to grind with these low paying programs, but I don't.  Seriously.  I see them as providing a great service.  The extremely low pay requirement incentives more employers to hire people in need, and to put up with a reasonable amount of issues that often come along with the employee.     **EDIT:**  Looks like it is not even nessisarily part of the specifc programs, but is an allowance under federal law.  In the good old US of A at least....  **\"A provision in the Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA) of 1938 gives employers the right to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage. At Goodwill, explains Leigland, disabled employees take a timed test to see how quickly they can sort and hang a rack of clothes. The garments must be facing to the left and the top buttons fastened and separated into men’s, women’s and children’s sections. Goodwill wants workers to be able to hang 100 garments with no errors in 32 minutes. “We can’t do it that quickly because we can’t look at a garment and see the size,” she says about her experience and her husband’s. Depending on how slow the employee works, Goodwill lowers the hourly wage.\"**\n",

They're not actually a burden, you just perceive it that way because they're not taking an equal share of the task, but the task you have is something you can handle without excess exertion, and the same goes for them.   Consider it this way. A large, strong person and a small, weak person are tasked with moving 300 lbs of stuff 100 feet. They resolve to carry it as the best method. An equal share would be 150 lbs, which the strong person would carry with relative ease (75% max load) while the weak would struggle unduly (125% max load). A more fair compromise would be perhaps a 200/100 split, or 125/175 even. Both workers will be pulling maximum output for their potential, perhaps like your store. (Though I will concede that your store may not be properly managed and they failed to take that into account, however I feel I've given you a good generalized case for how it could be fair even if in reality it is not in all situations)\n",

Your sharing of cookies ultimately leads to the bakery making money. Alternatively, if your friend is not me and can actually make food without burning down his domicile, you share the recipe with him and the market where you buy ingredients makes money (since clearly if you can replicate the taste at home, there isn't any need to go to the bakery). Either way, someone makes money as a result of the sharing of cookies.  However, when you give that same friend a ripped MP3 off of a CD, he NEVER NEEDS TO BUY ANYTHING.

Historically, a great way of making money from mines was to buy a bunch of slaves, throw them in it, have them dig stuff out for you regardless of the dangers, and pay them nothing for it. I suppose you'd be inclined to return to this time? What did or didn't happen historically is only relevant to the present in what mistakes we should seek to avoid making.

Manufacturing wasn't a \"traditional\" way of making money, so should we deny them money by breaking into the factory and stealing all the sofas? After all, by your own argument, manufacturing is only a recent (on even the human timescale) invention, and therefore not a traditional way of making money (or sofas, for that matter), so let's go steal the damn things! Perfectly OK, right?  You argument is so self serving that it's clear you care about nothing and no one except those you consider your immediate friends, family, and property. If you have a job, you'd argue that you yourself don't deserve a profit, that you should be paid nothing for your job and you should be content with it?

You're not sharing photos of a cookie - even if you argue that the live experience has an extra facet of reality to it, you can't simplify that to the picture of a cookie. You're still getting the essence of the cookie out of it when you pirate MP3s - you're just not getting the whole thing. You get the taste, but not the temperature, texture, crunchiness or softeness, smell, etc. It's closer to the difference between a real cookie and a cookie-flavored milk drink. And maybe you don't pay as much for a cookie-flavored milk drink as for a cookie, but somehow I doubt you claim \"This isn't a cookie,\" grab said drink, and sprint out of the grocery store, avoiding guards and police. This is, however, what you're advocating.  Your piracy of that music denies not only the musician, but also the recording technician, the track mixer, the CD burner, the CD printer, the distributor, and the retailer money.

Assign a score that corresponds to \"true user\" as P(test 1's result (positive or negative) on test 1| true user) * P(test 2's result on test 2|true user)...*P(true user), and a similar score to \"true nonuser\", normalize them, and get your probabilities there.

By the same proportion (of P(test history), which is unknown and sort of a silly thing to calculate) by which the same is true for the probabilities of a true nonuser.  Since we know that P(true user | test history) + P(true nonuser | test history) = 1 (by definition, true user and true nonuser are the only possibilities), surely we can normalize them to recreate the effect of knowing P(test history) without actually needing to do so?\n",

That role has been replaced by the de facto authority of Parliament  The Crown has several private properties- Balmoral for example, and retains private income from the Duchy of Lancaster, which itself became part of Crown lands in 1399 when Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, ascended to the throne. The fact that these entities lie separate to the Crown Estates demonstrates that they occupy slightly different legal places.  This legal nuance is explained in other Commonwealth nations, such as Canada and Australia, where 'Crown land' is the term synonymous with public land.  If the monarchy was deprived of its position, it would not automatically be handed the Crown Estate. At most it would be given the Duchy of Lancaster and its private houses. The vast majority of the 'Crown lands', and thus the vast majority of the wealth, would occupy a nebulous position somewhere within the hands of the nation, I believe. I would have to defer to a higher legal authority for clarification on this point. \n",

This is different from how governments are structured in the United States and countries in the Americas which have based their government off of the US. In this system, a directly elected president is both head of government and head of state at the cost of the legislative body being separate and often refusing to work with the president.

They are elected separately from the legislature, and have a different dynamic with the legislature (often they don't work together because they can be from separate parties).  In the Europe-style system the legislature elects a Prime Minister who is the head of government. Then there is either a ceremonial president or a ceremonial monarch who is head of state.  The PM could also be head of state, but this would unorthodox. No other country does it that way.

The head of state in this system represents the whole country, not just one political faction.   Also, the head of government is elected by the legislature which makes sure the entire government is on the same page (compare to gridlock in the US), but this is at the expenses of a check-and-balance.

The Lords also used to act as the supreme court until the 2009 when they created a proper UK Supreme Court.  Why? As a debating club, many non-politicians from a plethora of fields are appointed who can offer different insights. They also act as a check and balance against the Commons. Remember that the Commons and Executive are fused and the Supreme Court still can't deem laws unconstitutional as there is no written constitution. There are very few other built in checks and balances compared to a US-style government. Other reasons are that as a body it is conservative, so conservative administrations like it. Also it's part of tradition -- having a bicameral legislature is how it's been done for around a thousand years so people are reluctant to get rid of it.

You can reflect on them certainly, and say that **based on today's understandings** it was wrong, but families who were granted titles or lands or whatever based on now defunct laws cannot be dismissed as being 'undeserved' of their gains, because at the time they most likely were. I admit, there are plenty of cases of gains through nepotism or similar reasoning, but some were granted titles or land for valor in battle and other such actions.

      "\t\t>>\t I think this is he best way to sum this up. We have this horrible connotation that discrimination is always bad, but look around there's plenty of it already. We have separate bathrooms based on gender, separate schools that folks can choose to send their children to ect. The key here is equality. A women's shelter serves to make victims of abuse at the hands of men more comfortable, so in my book they're a good thing. However that is not to say we should not make these resources available to male victims of abuse in the same capacity. Unfortunately I don't really know of any male support groups for abuse survivors out there, but I think we should certainly have them.  A personal example of this that I can speak of came from my work. A little background I work at a public shooting range that in addition to holding public hours provides a number of free classes to people. Most of the classes are open to everyone but we have a few that are exclusively women's only classes. Our rationale is that when a female starts getting into firearms it can be very intimidating to shoot with a bunch of guys standing around watching. Because folks lets face it hunting and the shooting sports are primarily dominated by men. (There are tons of female shooters out there, just not near as many). So at one point we were short handed so I asked one of our volunteer instructors to come out and help. He said he could not in good conscious participate in a class that segregated by gender when there was no male equivalent (although he understood our reasoning for it). This didn't sit well with me, and made me think a lot. I started noticing that while I was helping some male customers in a shooting situation they seemed a bit put off. I'm the only girl that works at the range, and I feel that these particular men might have had some sort of aversion to me helping them. I mean stereotypically they should have been the ones who knew what they were doing, not some girl in her early twenties. I talked to my guy friends and they said that some guys might just have been embarrassed by getting instruction on what is seen as a masculine activity from a woman. Until that point I had never really thought about it, I was there to help whatever struggling shooters that needed help.   So we decided to do something about it. We now in addition to the woman's only class have a \"Guy's day at the range\" course. We didn't think it would do well but it has filled up just as quickly as the women's courses and has received good feedback! \n",

      "\t\t>>\t I agree with everything you say except for one important point. By pointing out that 40% of DV victims are men you are using data from the National Family Violence Survey, as I understand it. That fails to take into account the severity or frequency with which DV will happen. [This article](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mpj/2012%20VAW%20General%20Surveys.pdf) draws a distinction between situational couple violence and intimate terrorism. Situational couple violence is less severe and more contingent. Intimate terrorism is present consistently in relationships and much more severe, too often to the point of death. If we look at the rates for situational couple violence the gender distribution does seem fairly high. However if we look at the rates of intimate terrorism it is almost (but not entirely) exclusively men as the perpetrators and women as the victims. Both are domestic violence, but one is far less severe than the other. Both should have services to address their respective issues but it is absurd to claim that, as a general group, there are as many men in need of shelter from abuse as women.   For more reading, I recommend [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Public-Private-Families-Andrew-Cherlin/dp/0078026679/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419959288&sr=1-1&keywords=public+and+private+families+cherlin+7th+edition), which, although absurdly expensive, has a chapter that very clearly lays out the distinction and points out more sources than I have. \n",

      "\t\t>>\t I have issues with the article that you linked. Here are a few of them:  > leads us to hypothesize that it is primarily a matter of men abusing women, for at least the following reasons. First, the use of violence as one tactic in an attempt to exercise general control over one’s partner requires more than the willingness to do violence. It requires a credible threat of a damaging violent response to non-compliance (M. A. Dutton & Goodman, 2005). Such a threat is, of course, more credible coming from a man than a woman simply because of the size difference in most heterosexual couples. Second, experience with violence and individual attitudes toward violence make such threats more likely and more credible from a man than from a woman. (7)  Although this is just their hypothesis, it does come from a biased viewpoint that men are more likely to be violent... because men are more likely to be violent? That type of circular reasoning rubs me the wrong way. Further, size difference doesn't matter much; a man might (maybe) be able to knock you out more effectively, but a woman is just as capable of slapping someone as a man is.  > They found that traditional men were more likely to be involved in attacks on their partners than were non-traditional men (8)  So what, exactly, is a \"traditional man?\" The implication is \"one who is more likely to violence\" for the reasons listed in the first section that I've quoted, which again leads to the circular reasoning of \"men who are more violent are likely to be more violent, because they're more violent.\"  >When a woman slaps her Intimate husband in the heat of an argument, it is unlikely to be interpreted by him as a serious attempt to do him physical harm. Women’s violence is less likely to injure, is taken less seriously, is less likely to produce fear, and is therefore less likely either to be intended as a control tactic or to be successful as one. (8-9)  This here is *outright* ignoring of woman-on-man violence. The paper clearly brushes the impact of WoM violence under the rug.  > a view of marriage as a commitment “for better or worse,” [...] can contribute to the entrapment of women in abusive relationships. (9)  While technically true, this article completely ignores the fact that it could *also* contribute to a man feeling trapped in the relationship \"for better or worse.\"  That's just the first 9 pages, and there's already enough to discredit the paper. It's nothing but biased crap.   Don't get me wrong--I'm *all for* really reading into the data. I *wholeheartedly* agree that it's a very good tactic to read into the relationships between things, and sometimes to draw whacky, counterintuitive conclusions that nonetheless accurately describe something, and I think that doing so is the superior method of analyzing data.   However, that's not what this paper is doing. It's clearly drawing a conclusion and then fitting data to that conclusion.  EDIT: Let me rephrase something that I said. This article is mostly quoting other articles, so it's less true that \"this article is brushing things under the rug\" and more true that \"this article is a collection of quotes from *other* articles that brush the issue under the rug, and as such retains that bias.\"\n",

It was shut down hard by feminists and is one of the major grievances that is responsible for the negative connotations around the word feminism.

It's rather interesting from a sociological perspective (especially in light of the arguments for focusing on women in these matters) since simply focusing on non-reciprocal abuse flips the ratio. The data on abuse in same sex relationships is similarly damning for the currently prevailing view as male-male relationships have a lower incidence of abuse than male-female relationships which in turn have a lower incidence than female-female. Of course actually looking at the data (while ignoring the definitions that are designed to artificially support existing narratives) it becomes clear that things like domestic abuse and rape are not gendered issues but human ones and thus both far harder and necessary to solve. \n",

      "\t\t>>\t What I posted was a sociological article. As such it uses some terminology in a context which is unique to the field. For example, a traditional man is somebody who is more likely to hurt people because a traditional man is aggressive and domineering. This is not all men by ANY means whatsoever, but it is the image of masculinity that society pressures men to live up to. Traditional masculinity is hegemonic masculinity, a search term that might get you some useful articles to help in understanding the concept.   A lot of the other issues you take umbrage with are, I think, a result of a poor reading of what is being said. For instance, that first passage you reference is not saying men are more likely to be violent because they are more likely to be violent. It is saying that threats of violence are more credible coming from men because of the socializing institutions which imagine the ideal man as aggressive and the ideal woman as submissive. When a man threatens a woman, we view that as a serious threat because we have an image of how men ought to be. When a woman threatens a man, we don't take that threat seriously because that contrasts with traditional feminine gender roles. Threats of violence from men are more credible and serious because we expect them to be more credible and serious. That's all.   I grant you that this article takes a lot of things for granted, and if you have a problem with how this article defines traditional gender roles there is a wealth of academic literature of that subject. I suppose I shouldn't have assumed that a sociological article in a nonsociological subreddit would have been read from a sociological lens, though.\n",

The quote says several things. 1) Men are \"credible\" sources of violence. 2) Implied: women are *not* credible sources of violence. 3) Physical size is the determining factor as to what constitutes a credible source of violence. 4) Men are inherently more experienced than women with violence.   So what does that add up to? 4, men are inherently more experienced with violence, therefore 1, men are more credible sources of violence; men are more likely to be violent because men are more violent. That's not an issue with my reading comprehension. Even if we were to argue about the word \"credible,\" which I don't care to, that still leaves the word \"serious;\" the article is clearly implying that threats from men are serious threats and threats from women are not serious threats, *even when the woman is actually hitting the man.*  As I said, I'm all for interpreting the data through whichever lens fits. But claiming that \"oh, you wouldn't understand, it's a sociological thing\" doesn't make up for the lackluster article.

His suicide note didn't say that he blamed feminists or proponents of anything, only the government.  Should men get funding, sure. But it's not really a zero sum game either.

Desktop was predominantly the store to purchase a product, deeper dives on product pages, or support.

      "text/plain": "['No, resources would still be consumed, just we would theoretically be so efficient a finite amount of resources is not a problem. I mostly used the term post scarcity because op used it, but in reality the \"utopia\" to be expected in the short term from automation is just a form a socialism, so nothing to be excited about, unless you really hate working. No the automation you are talking about has many historical precedents.  Machines replace humans when they become better or more efficient at a job then a human could be.  You are merely talking about a state when there are no jobs left that are better done by a human.  However I am saying that this will never happen because throughout history when machines have taken over for what we are doing, this merely causes us to come up with something new to do. After some time we come up with a way to replace this new activity with a machine and so on and so forth.  A drive is not enough if there is no possible oppertunity for it to succeed. I dont think you understand what I mean by automation. All humans do as workers is use their intelligence or strength to achieve goals. The human brain is akin to an organic computer, and we can design ones that are superior to it. The human muscle is nothing compared to machines, so all manual labor is also becoming unproductive. What does that leave for humans? Nothing large enough to employ the global workforce, or any significant proportion of it. Is post-scarcity even possible? How much of the earth would we constantly need to be consuming to upkeep that kind of tech? It wouldn\\'t come from nowhere right? Think about replicators from star trek. Assuming, for a moment, that they are possible,  they would fundamentally alter the entire economy. I assume they would effectively take waste and trash, break them down into atomic or sub atomic components and rebuild them into whatever someone wanted.   Resources become a lot less finite at that point. Two things: A post scarcity economy is not defined by the absence of jobs, but by the lack of economic need for them.   Secondly, the automation I am referring to does not have a historical precedence. This is not about replacing a weak human welder with a untiring robot, this is about replacing the slow human brain with an efficient and specialized ai. In many fields human intelligence would be akin to outdated technology. Think of how horses were replaced by the superior automobile. Very few horses still work today, because they are only viable in verry narrow circumstances. The same will occur for humans, and like the horses, there is no real reason we will find new work just because we lost our economic value. You are also assuming there will ever be a \"post scarcity\" period...  There is very little data supporting the idea that automation = less job opportunity overall.  There is some data that automation advances in a a given industry can reduce job opportunities in that industry for a period however there are very few instances where this is not made up for in scale. I.E. higher automation leads to growth in the industry which then leads to it hiring more people again, despite needing less people per unit produced.  Because no limit of human usefulness was conceivable 400 years ago does not mean that limit does not exist. If someone from 2400 told me of the things they were doing I imagine it would be equally astounding, but I doubt these tasks would be being done by humans. Why? Economic value can not be forced onto a tool. When we have the technology that makes any possible task currently done by a human more cost effective, why would there be any need to hire humans? What can a human do that ais can not do better? Theoretically, nothing. In reality there are some functions that will take longer to automate than others, but time will eventually see all human labor as economically antiquated. That is what someone in the 1500s would have said if you told them that in the future no one would ever have to farm again.  \"What else is there to do?\"   and then you would say  \"Well you can make huge contraptions made out of the black stuff that fire makes that fly through the air at 100x the speed of the fastest bird.\"  And they would tell you to go get your head checked. Because humans have an innate drive to do stuff. Horses never did, horses did what they were told to do, we dont, we do what we feel like doing. It used to be that everyone was a farmer, than technology progressed, now almost no one is farmer. Now we do other stuff, we do stuff that people in the 1500s would have though impossible or absurd.  So its probably safe to say that 500 years from now people will be doing stuff that we now think is impossible and absurd. See this is where I lose you.  \"Human Usefulness\" is irrelevant, we don\\'t need smart phones, we don\\'t need airplanes, we don\\'t need luxury watches or fancy suits or any of it. There are millions of things that exist and are beloved that serve no use in terms of base survival (reddit for example). But we do them because we enjoy it, I can create a machine that plays golf better than I play golf, but then I wouldn\\'t get to play golf.  We could create machines that argue about pointless shit on Reddit better than you or me, but then we wouldn\\'t get to do that either and that\\'s no fun.  So long as humans are the judges of value, we will always have value.',\n 'There is no such thing as \"de facto acceptance of Israel\\'s nuclear program.\" the Non-Proliferation Treaty is only binding for signatory states. Israel is not a signatory. because international law doesn\\'t require states to sign treaties, it only requires them to adhere to treaties they\\'ve already signed. Israel isn\\'t defying the UN, at least not in this particular case. Think of the NPT less like a standard law within a state and more like a contract. Once you\\'ve signed, you\\'re bound by the contract, but if you never sign it then you haven\\'t broken a law, you\\'ve just decided not to agree to the terms you were offered. > Because Iran did sign the treaty, and thus are bound by it. They signed on July 1, 1968.  Hmm. So is the argument here that it\\'s not \"ok\" for Iran to have a nuke, since they signed treaty not to do so. But it\\'s \"ok\" for Israel to have one because they never signed such thing?  Can\\'t quite put my finger on it, but doesn\\'t seem quite right this one. Article 10 of the NPT allows them to withdraw if they so choose. they have not done so. It\\'s more accurate, I think, to say that the problem with Iran here from a legal standpoint is that they aren\\'t honoring their own commitments, rather than that they\\'re building weapons. They could pull out of the NPT at any time, and the ball would be essentially in America\\'s court, because their nuclear program would no longer be illegal by international legal standards. However, Iran insists both on developing nukes *and* remaining an NPT signatory non-nuclear state, and that\\'s what makes their program illegal.    I\\'d also like to clarify that I\\'m not making an ethical argument here, this is just how international law currently works.  a whole new country which explicitly has a right to withdraw from the NPT and has not chosen to do so. it\\'s already been signed. They even claim to be adhering to it, though they\\'ve been found to be violating it before.',\n '> random/semi-irrational posts   Could you elaborate on this? or at least show some examples.

The main point was meant to be he created a bunch of random/semi-irrational posts and, simultaneously, said he had nothing to fear because of the above/often-reposted comments...',\n 'Just as a side Christianity isn\\'t your best example. There\\'s a famous part of the Bible where Jesus says precisely not to stone people. There\\'s a difference between hating something and telling someone else you hate that thing.  I might hate the color pink, but I wouldn\\'t say that to someone wearing pink, because they\\'d be offended.  But I can hate the color and think it is ugly without hating the person wearing it.  I definitely hate organized religions that teach false things.  It doesn\\'t mean I hate the practitioners of it, because they may be confused, or duped, or just following what they grew up with, or any number of reasons.  Likewise, I am not particularly offended if people hate MY religion.  Even though it is, of course, true, they don\\'t KNOW that it is... why wouldn\\'t they hate what they (wrongly, of course) believe to be false and therefore harmful?  But neither they nor I need to be dicks about it.  I don\\'t go up to people and say \"I hate your religion\" because they would be offended.  They would take it personally because they identify so strongly with their religion that an attack on one they perceive as an attack on them.  And maybe it IS an attack on them... but the view was that one could do so without hate.  I can definitely attack a person\\'s beliefs without hating that person.  I think Islam is a false, destructive religion.  I bear no hatred towards muslims.  They probably wouldn\\'t *believe* me when I say that, but that\\'s up to them.  I wouldn\\'t tell a muslim I met \"I think your religion is all lies and people are going to suffer in hell for following that false prophet Muhammed.\"  They would be upset, and that is a predictable thing.  But hating the religion doesn\\'t mean I hate the person.  Maybe I even hate some of their opinions or thought processes.  But that still doesn\\'t mean I hate the person.  I could even love them, in the sense of wanting the best for them.  (But the best would likely include learning the truth.) I think there\\'s a difference between a belief that a person has (i.e. a thought - which I agree should not be judged) and an organized system that you participate in (i.e. a religion). If you think god exists, that\\'s fine and I shouldn\\'t hate you for that. But if you, for example, participate in a mission trip to convert people to your religion - then I absolutely think you ought to be judged.  Since organized religion tends to make recommendation on how you act I think it is entirely to possible to condemn these recommendations without attacking your belief in a particular deity. As a corrolary - do you believe it is wrong to hate certain ideologies simply because some people believe in them? There is a difference between insulting an individual and insulting ideas individuals may hold.  I discourage the former and encourage the latter.  If it\\'s the same passage I think of he says not to stone one specific person iirc but I guess you\\'re right overall. I hope you get what i meant though. If not replace Christianity with Islam and stoning children for not obeying with killing people who want to stop being muslim. >Hate is a strong word yes, but you can hate ideas because you believe them to be morally wrong.  Funny, this is how religious people think because in their eyes they are objectively right because \"God\" or whatever has the final say in what goes on and is their basis for morals instead of common sense/logic. (Which was in short supply when those religions were created in the first place) These days we know murder, rape, paedophilia, etc. is unanimously wrong.    The reason why it\\'s so hard to talk/debate with some religious people is because they think they\\'re in the right because of what some human wrote down in lieu of \"God\". Some of them don\\'t want to change while others conform to humanist/secular thinking of the modern world. (Moderate/liberal religious people)   I think instead of hating people/ideas and having black and white thinking they should treat each situation as it comes because morality is totally subjective. As I said earlier, what we might see as wrong, murder, etc. other\\'s might see as an excuse to express their religion, birthright, opinion, etc. in the form of whatever they might please. (Jihad, Crusades, Manifest Destiny, Genocide, Eugenics, etc.)   I would actually label them GOOD and there should be as much shit flinging (in various arenas) as possible.  When I attend my child\\'s elementary school play I hope the shit flinging is kept to a minimum however when I enter a movie theater I hope that shit flinging is frequent and in extreme abundance.    I think the recent \"Interview\" (Seth Rogan/James Franco) movie is a good example.   Now just because shit flinging is in the movie doesn\\'t mean that movies should make a ton of money, but society should strive to create venues (like movie theaters and magazines) where there is no limit to the amount of shit flinging one may encounter.    Another good example is reddit.  I am not personally subscribed to the \\'iamgoingtohellforthis\\' subreddit but I am glad that a venue like reddit exists and where that type of discourse is boundless.  And even though reddit may not endorse the messages in that subreddit reddit should be praised for creating a venue where that is possible.   Just so we are clear insulting Muhammad the prophet is an example of insulting an idea not a individual.  I don\\'t understand your analogy.  Promoting a culture that regularly ridicules institutions like Harvard I think is a good thing.   The ridicule can then be analyzed with the arguments that frequently accompany it.   I want to live in a society where all of my values and ideas are openly and regularly mocked in the public sphere.  I think that is a good thing.   Now if I invite you over to my house for pizza night and you insult me then you are just an asshole and you won\\'t be invited to pizza night next week.  But if you are writing a blog or posting on reddit or drawing a cartoon for a magazine I think you should take the position that nothing is sacred and all ideas should be ridiculed. > Your religion is morally disgusting and doesn\\'t make any logical sense. Do you know what science is? But you\\'re not so bad.  As an example we can agree that stoning kids because they don\\'t obey is wrong. If I then talk to a christian who doesn\\'t do that I could tell him that his religion is morally disgusting because it says he should do that but he\\'s a nice person.  If he doesn\\'t act on what I don\\'t like about his religion there shouldn\\'t be a problem in me pointing it out. If he does it should be ok for me to dislike him.',\n 'What God?

Some smell kinda funky.',\n ' I really liked your explanation, and OP\\'s non-answer was pretty hilarious. It sounded like a politician dodging a question.   I always have a similar sort of critique to anyone arguing for guns as a personal safety/protection tool. Guns escalate situations, and make people more unpredictable. It sounds so silly to me when people suggest they would be increase their safety by winning some sort of James Bond gun-fight over an imaginary foe.   Except police training isn\\'t like riding a bike.  You don\\'t just lean it once and then you\\'re good for life.  Being prepared for an active shooter scenario is gonna need constant practice, both mental and physical.  Most police officers wouldn\\'t even be prepared for these kind of situations, which is why we have SWAT teams that specialize in those kind of scenarios(I\\'d also like to point out that if we wanted to train millions of people to SWAT levels of proficiency it would be comically expensive and I have no idea who would pay for it).  Add in the fact that the situation would likely be even more stressful than the average SWAT raid since the civilians have no knowledge of any of the other participants and were completely unprepared in the moment, and do you still feel that training which would necessarily be brief and infrequent enough to allow for these people to have other jobs would be extensive enough to mitigate dangers I brought up?  Because I just don\\'t see that happening. That is far, *far* easier said than done.  If you aren\\'t looking at the shooter when the shooter opens fire, then the average civilian has very little chance of correctly responding to this situation instinctively.  A lot(I would guess a majority) of people are going to perceive anyone shooting in their direction at all as a threat.  Say the shooter enters at one end of the room and someone at the other end returns fire.  How are all of the people in between to know that the second guy is trying to hit the criminal and not them?  I know you said that you think these people should be trained, but how much training do you think is reasonable to expect before we give them a gun, especially if we want to get such a huge number of people armed?  To be able to respond in a situation like that requires constant training and practice, and it\\'s not realistic to expect so many people to do that when they aren\\'t police or military.  It\\'s just not realistic to expect a full fifth of our population to be able to react like SWAT team members at the drop of a hat. Yeah, police officers that I\\'ve talked to have told me that if shit like this goes down civilians should run.  If they can\\'t run, they should hide.  Only when options one and two are out of the question does engaging become your best bet, and even then it\\'s only because option four is get shot.  They also said that if option one or two ever present themselves again, take them and get out of dodge, and let the police do their job when they get there. It certainly is, but the OP was proposing that mass shootings could be mitigated by having a large number of citizens who are prepared to return fire, which is(in my estimation) simply not the case. Well I don\\'t think this it is required to be SWAT-level trained, it isn\\'t hard to teach people if not sure just stay on the safe side and don\\'t pull out the gun and shoot. It should be standard to pull out gun only when you are going to shoot, so if someone aims at you you know his intentions and everyone would know this so they won\\'t be stupid and aiming at random people. Well that is my point that the negatives you are envisioning wouldn\\'t happen often enough to outweigh the benefits, as the people allowed to have the guns would understand this and wouldn\\'t be just a common Joe who decided to get a gun on his way home from work. Well there already are a bunch of people who legally carry guns, aren\\'t cops and there haven\\'t been any significant number of reports of them abusing their power, while there have been lot of reports of cops abusing their power and criminals carrying guns. The problem here is that you\\'re only looking at an isolated incident where the scenario is already playing out.  That\\'s kind of like talking about the concept of mutually assured destruction with respect to nuclear weapons by only talking about the impact of a missile hitting a city.  The point of a MAD scenario is that the threat of retaliation is so strong that you are deterred from acting in the first place.  For the extreme case, if literally everyone was carrying a gun, and everyone else knew this, it isn\\'t unreasonable to propose that people would feel less confident trying to pull off an armed robbery or a shooting in the first place, and so the situation would be avoided entirely.  [One town passed a law requiring everyone to own a gun, and their crime rate is now half what it was prior, so it\\'s not a completely random postulate.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennesaw,_Georgia#Crime_statistics) It would be different because the people with the guns wouldn\\'t live among the policemen day by day on their paycheck, in short they wouldn\\'t be policemen and share (most of) their problems and incentives. Yeah I of course considered a scenario similar to the one you outline, however I think that the gun owners would be prepared to deal with these situations and their risks. The simplest thing is only to return fire if someone is firing on you or those you know have no intention to kill somebody. See, you say this. But if a shooter opened fire on a crowd, and it was you and your family there, would you still feel the same way? That you\\'re glad nobody else has a gun? What you are asking for amounts to a trained police force, yet you went out of your way to say you don\\'t want to arm the police force exclusively for fear of a police state. How would this be any different? These people with guns would still be the ones calling the shots (literally). Whether or not they correctly identify the right shooter (which is incredibly hard even with training, much less without), they will still be shooting to kill people. This will only increase the deaths in each mass shooting since more people will be doing the shooting.  I already said in different comments that this wouldn\\'t be able to detract suicide attacks. However it should be able to to limit their effectivity. Guns only escalate a situation *if they\\'re brought into it*.  There seems to be a common misconception that those of us that carry actually WANT to use deadly force.  People seem to think that we\\'ll pull at the drop of a hat.  While there are undoubtedly a few a-holes among us that do, the *VAST* majority simply do not think that way.  In point of fact, *most* people who carry understand the weight of the tool at their disposal.  We understand that if we believe the situation warrants use of a gun then we\\'ve decided this is a life-or-death situation.  Thankfully, most average citizens, gun carriers or not, never encounter such situations.  Speaking for myself, I only have once in my life and it was more than 25 years now... and, I managed to survive it without a gun.  But when you do, the alternatives are facing it with a tool that we all know is effective at it\\'s job, or going at it without that tool.  Even though I survived my one such case without a gun I wouldn\\'t want to make the gamble a second time.  No, the truth is that most people who carry understand that carrying a gun makes you the pussy in the room.  It makes you the person that backs down from any and all confrontations long before they escalate to the point of needing a gun.  They understand that they are the ones that take the insults and just walk away.  We keep our anger in check at all times.  We\\'re also the ones that are paying attention to our surroundings at all times, not burying our faces in our phones and whatnot, because we understand that situational awareness is the key to staying alive whether you have a gun or not.  We notice the little details.  We move to the other side of the street if we think we see trouble coming (whether it \"looks bad\" or not).  We\\'re the ones that, more importantly, won\\'t even *BE* on that street in the first place.  Like I said, I\\'m sure you can find examples of people who carry who do so with the wrong mindset.  But if you spend any time around people who do carry you\\'ll quickly realize those people are few and far between.  We\\'re perfectly normal people, just like you, who just so happen to not want to be in a situation where we can\\'t defend our lives.  Simple as that. You need to consider that in shootings maybe even the death counts per shooting would be same or maybe even a bit higher, but if it decreased the number of shootings so that the total death count from shootings would decrease it would be a success - the role as a detractor is important.  It would be easier to train civilians because their role is fundamentally different from the police. They would be only in role of defenders, not chasing down criminals or anything police and SWAT do. They perhaps would rarely be able to stop the first deaths of a mass shooting, but should be more effecting in stopping subsequent deaths. How does expecting them to defend themselves and those around them against attackers give them power? You are assuming that spree shooters are going to rationally decide not to commit their crimes because they fear that they might be killed.  This is flawed logic.  Spree shooters are essentially always either killed or captured immediately following their crime in the culture that already exists.  Spree shooters know this before they do anything, and will often leave manifestos behind in anticipation of this.  Spree shooters either are irrational actors who believe themselves to be invincible or the exception, or they intend to die and want to take as many people as they can with them.  There have been many shootings in gun free areas, but there is no indication that the shooters would have just decided that they didn\\'t want to commit mass murder because the chances of their survival or escape(which are minimal already) are lowered. I was focusing on that scenario because it\\'s the one proposed in the OP, not because I think it\\'s the strongest individual argument for gun control.  Kennesaw is an interesting piece of anecdotal evidence, but such a specific example that I\\'ve never given it much credence as a predictor of how increasing gun ownership would change society.  It might work in some small towns, but most places aren\\'t going to have the same results.  They actually seem to be proving that since their crime rate is now increasing as their population goes up, though there could be other factors as well. I think it should be something of a level of the police training. Completing it should have benefits maybe even outside of the social stature. Do you have any evidence to back up that assertion?  Because I\\'ve seen videos of people who just went through gun safety and combat training accidentally shoot themselves and each other with their paintball pistols when an ambush was simulated immediately after being told their course was over(can\\'t remember where the videos were, I\\'ll add them if I can find them later).  You seem to be handwaving how easy it would be to train people to go against their survival instincts and maintain a detached situation awareness in the face of death.  It takes months of training for both police and military before they are ready for active duty, and then they have constant ongoing training and evaluation to stay sharp.  Why would it be easier to train more civilians in less time? I say that they would share more incentive to abuse their power. They aren\\'t policemen, they have no job description forbidding them from abusing their power wielded with the guns. Just because you wouldn\\'t does not guarantee these people would make the same choice as you But the difference is that right now the people carrying the guns are not expected to uphold the peace. They have no power to abuse at the moment, but give it to them and they will abuse it, that is human nature Wikipedia lists 82 mass killings in America (pop: 316 mil), and 11 in France (pop: 66 mil). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers_(Americas) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers_(Europe)  That\\'s 1 mass killer per 4 million americans, or per 6 million french.  Why haven\\'t more guns in USA equaled fewer mass shootings? Depends on what goes down.  If there\\'s some Jason Bourne type in the crowd who just pulls and puts the guy down right away I\\'d be thrilled.  But I think that it\\'s more likely that someone who isn\\'t prepared to deal with the stress and chaos of the situation will probably do more harm than good.  And the more people in the crowd all acting on their own, with no knowledge of which other shooters they should be shooting and and which ones they should be helping, the worse the situation is going to become.    I think that scenario is more likely, especially if we start encouraging a social norm that as many people as possible should be prepared to open fire at a moments notice.  So I\\'ll play the odds and say that we should avoid a culture with that expectation.  There may be a few shootings that go on longer than they would have in OPs proposed world, but overall there will be far fewer deaths if we don\\'t go that way. In any emergency situation, the only thing more gunfire, no matter how well intentioned, will do, is add to the confusion and increase the victims. I know if I were a terrorist looking to shoot as many innocent people as I could, I would love for someone to return fire at me - having 20% of the crowd begin firing at each other in the confusion would be a wet dream. They\\'d probably end up killing more people than any single terrorist, no matter how well-armed, could hope to do.  I\\'m pretty certain that if you went to any professional gun convention or NRA meeting, and began shooting at people, everyone with a brain would simply take cover and wait for the cops to come. Because they know guns and they know the *worst* thing to do in that situation would be to use them.',\n ' > My contention is that the original cartoonists used their right to free expression in a nasty, childish, and destructive manner. And that\\'s the part I take issue with. The cartoonists that drew these are not Muslim (presumably).  They don\\'t live in a Muslim country, they didn\\'t grow up with Muslim culture, and they don\\'t live under Muslim law.  So they drew cartoons lampooning something just like they do politicians, celebrities, and other religious figures, because where they live and grew up, there\\'s nothing immoral about that.  Your morals are a function of the culture you grew up in.  They didn\\'t do it to antagonize.  They did it for the same reason they draw anyone else.  To make a political argument.   The point of the first cartoons was not to show anyone anything.  The point of the LATER cartoons was exactly to \"show \\'them\\' that we could.\"   Bacon sandwiches have some purpose, represent some good to the people consuming them. That is in fact the primary purpose of consuming a bacon sandwich. It is *possible* to be offensive while consuming a bacon sandwich, but that is not the intention of most people eating bacon sandwiches.  The purpose of these cartoons is not nourishment or enrichment. I would argue that their primary purpose is not even entertainment. They exist for no other reason than to insult a group of people. You can choose to be a dick to someone, and you don\\'t deserve to be killed for it. But no one should pretend like you\\'re a hero for choosing to to be a needless dick to a group of people. The full circle is actually a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where one negative action begets a further destructive response. This isn\\'t rhetorical: what was the point of the original Muhammad cartoons? To show \"them\" that we could, their feelings be damned? Something else?  Just because we can do something doesn\\'t mean we should do something. My contention is that the original cartoonists used their right to free expression in a nasty, childish, and destructive manner. The response was a crime against humanity and I don\\'t want to blame the victims for that, but we should not be glorifying the provocateurs as martyrs who upheld our values. No, they abused them.   So basically, The World saw a Big Red Button in the Muslim faith and couldn\\'t help but press it. So, we started it.   Now, of course, any rational human being would say \"that offends me, I\\'d appreciate it if you wouldn\\'t do that\" instead of \"I\\'m going to decapitate your whole family.\" That\\'s where my sympathy stops, and I re-side with the rest of The World.   But basically, you walked into a Deli and overheard the shop owner on the phone with his wife saying \"Boy, does bacon offend me.\" Then you step up to the counter with a devilish grin and say, \"I\\'ll have a bacon sandwich. Haha.\"   Whether the shopkeeper simply frowns or pulls out a shotgun at that point is moot, as far as my argument goes.  The first bacon sandwich came about because 90% of the world (made up statistic) has no problem eating bacon, just like there\\'s a sizable percentage of the world that isn\\'t offended by images of Muhammed and isn\\'t prohibited by any law (religious or civil) that says they can\\'t draw them.  So they did.  They made that bacon sandwich.  In the real world, Jews see people eating bacon sandwiches all the time and don\\'t care.  They\\'re not going to do it themselves because their faith forbids it, but they\\'re also not going to try to tell you that YOU can\\'t have a bacon sandwich.  And they\\'re damn sure not going to murder you for it.  But in this case, the reaction was to threaten violence and murder for eating that sandwich.  So, in response, scores of people said \"We\\'ll be damned if you\\'re going to scare us into not eating bacon sandwiches just because YOU don\\'t think it\\'s right.  We\\'re ALL getting bacon sandwiches!\" Well, I doubt you\\'re going to find any comic that isn\\'t poking fun, since that\\'s the point of a comic, to illustrate a point, but the comics in question are no more offensive than any other political cartoon that pokes fun at every other religion imaginable.   http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/things/depictions-of-muhammad-examples.htm Clearly done in a much more tactful way, but also technically fulfilling your request. I would point out that what the OP is looking for is much harder to get a clear bead on. Basically we would need to pair such an image with someone attempting to censor it, which requires digging into very recent history (usually incredibly obscure). You\\'re changing the level of generality here to shift the debate. Yes, political cartoons absolutely have a purpose, no one is arguing otherwise. But the cartoons depicting Muhammad in a crude and vulgar manner only exist to inflame and insult. I have yet to see one cartoon that depicts Muhammad as a racist Arab caricature that serves a higher purpose.  In a free society, people don\\'t need a high purpose to publish anything they choose to draw. This much is true. But we should not paint these cartoonists as martyrs. They intended to inflict pain upon a community. You might not recognize the psychic pain of a Muslim who loves Muhammad and sees him depicted as a crook nosed rapist as something worthy of your contemplation, but that doesn\\'t mean the pain doesn\\'t exist.  Some individuals in the group these cartoonists intentionally hurt chose to retaliate with violence. This is of course inexcusable and an order of magnitude worse than the original offense. The men who did this deserve no quarter in any civilized society. But a civilized society should likewise not canonize the original malicious intent of the cartoonists as a form of nobility. >That world not hypothetical. Christians have indeed killed people for blasphemy. Point.  In the past when some Christians were doing that, then. What the OP is looking for you to confirm or point to is innocuous, non-antagonistic comics etc. that just happen to picture the Muhammad.  That is the \"first bacon sandwich\" he meant.   We\\'ve come back full circle to the beginning of this discussion.  There are two different sets of cartoons in play here: 1) The original political cartoons years ago that started this backlash against cartoonists depicting Muhammed.  These cartoons were not meant to offend.  They weren\\'t drawn as just some crude and vulgar way to incite anger in people.  They were drawn, like any other political cartoon, to make a political point.  The response from Islamists was \"You can\\'t do that because our faith forbids it.\"  They responded with threats of violence (and in some cases actual violence.) 2) Later cartoons that were drawn in counter-response to those threats.  These are the comics about which you\\'re now talking.  The ones that definitely ARE meant to make a strong point and offend.  Those comics are very much standing up for free speech since they are a direct response to those that seek to take that freedom away through violent means.   the difference is its not illigal or wrong for non muslims to do so, they holding us to a standard they chose is not our problem  also, newspaper is not an individual or group, so its not targeted, offense isn\\'t given,  people take it because it suits their ways, What you\\'re saying makes sense, but there\\'s something I don\\'t understand about your hypothetical. The bacon sandwich is presumably a metaphor for a printed image of Muhammad. This would mean that someone, somewhere printed such an image publicly that caused the Muslim extremists to react. If this was done benevolently, such as for education or out of ignorance or anything other than satire or malice, then I emphatically agree that the artists at Charlie Hebdo were to be lauded for their fight against censorship. But I feel this may be being overly reductive, so would you mind shedding a little more light onto the origin of this first bacon sandwich? Satire IS  valuable end. Ideals that wish to be immune from criticism are the ones which should be criticized the most. The cartoons 10 years ago were not intended to\\'offend\\' merely to criticize. Many of today\\'s cartoons also contain valuable commentary and criticism, also being a big FU to those who want to prevent an image of a guy being published. (I can only assume because of the fear of accidentally worshipping him as a false Idol). Cartoons that didn\\'t mock muhamed are just as inflamatory as those that do. I think the only purpose on satirizing the muslim prophet is in establishing that nothing is sacred.  If one thing is considered sacred then it is up to some arbitrary line over which you get executed for expressing yourself.  It is important that that line doesn\\'t exist. That world not hypothetical. Christians have indeed killed people for blasphemy. That\\'s not true at all.  Political cartoons don\\'t exist just to piss people off and make fun of people.  They\\'ve been around for centuries as a way to make an editorial point in a way that words can\\'t effectively accomplish.  They *do* exist to persuade, to educate, to encourage conversation. There are undoubtedly plenty that DO just aim to piss people off, but to say that anyone drawing a political cartoon is just trying to start a fight is incorrect. I think OP is just an apologist.  It doesn\\'t matter whether people were trying to offend the Islamic faith or it\\'s followers.  The point is that these comics are always meant to offend someone, and people of the Islamic faith think they should get special treatment because they have a law against it. Printing an image of Muhammad is just as much standing up for free speech as newspapers printing \"Jesus never died for your sins\" in the hypothetical world where Christians killed someone over writing that.  > Why do you need to keep doing it? I agree that people should have the right to say and print what they wish, but why do you need to be a dick for no reason? They had a reason. Satire like that is generally used to depict the absurdity of a social or political topic or situation in ways, that can\\'t be expressed as well by other means. In the case of the recent Mohamed caricatures were in response to the death threats issued to earlier caricatures (that had a different intent, that is irrelevant to this). The caricatures were openly mocking those death threats by existing, throwing the attempt to censor artists in the face of those extremists. From a more abstract point of view, they further revealed the absurdity by inciting more death threats. In short: Those initial death threats (and not the offence of moderate Muslims) was the reason for the caricatures. They were an statement of resistance against the attempt to suppress opposition by death threats using the means of satire. \"somewhere printed such an image publicly THAT CAUSED the Muslim extremists to react.\" No, someone CHOSE to react to a printed picture. Every day someone may hurt someone else\\'s feelings, but as rational and respectful human beings, we let it go.  The first \"bacon sandwich\" can exist for any reason whatsoever and requires no justification or apology. No, you\\'re playing it like someone found out that Jews don\\'t approve of bacon, so opened up a bacon shop in the middle of their community and went around laying bacon on everyone\\'s doorsteps.    The point here was never to antagonize anyone.  We didn\\'t walk into a clearly Jewish deli and, with a big asshole grin on our face, say \"Give me some bacon\".  We were sitting in a deli that proudly serves bacon, and someone walked in and demanded that we not eat it.  Just like these cartoons weren\\'t published in the parts of the world where they would offend.  They were published in western countries where freedom of expression is an understood concept.  It is the offended parties who showed up and started screaming.  The battle was not taken to them, it was brought to us.   Your analogy would be more apt if we had gotten these cartoons into the papers in Saudi Arabia, or flown over the area dropping paper copies of the cartoons onto Muslim communities with the sole intention of pissing them off.   ',\n '>This isn\\'t to say I\\'m smarter - I just already know what arguments they\\'re going to make, why they might be wrong, what refutations exist, counter-arguments, what alternative views there might be, and even how points can be expressed differently.  I completely agree.  And not only can you be uneducated on the history of what arguments have been made and their responses, but there\\'s something about *if-then* type reasoning itself that you need to study to understand.  A lot of people are very educated in that they know a lot of facts, but don\\'t understand the structure of arguments.  The most frustrating arguments are when someone is using true premises, but concluding something that just doesn\\'t follow from them. &#8710;  Your analogies really helped. It\\'s really just as much of a skillset obtained and refined as any other field, isn\\'t it?  >Why restrict it to 50 years? I can name all sorts of accomplishments that philosophy has contributed to throughout history  So... none?  One reason to restrict it to fifty years is to try and dodge the tiresome effort that every philosophy apologist will attempt, which is to claim big things that happened in the past as the products of philosophy.  For example: \"Some of the founding fathers read philosophical books, probably, ergo, philosophy invented America.\"  >The American Republic didn\\'t just arise out of thin air  The American Republic was founded by experienced statesmen, building off of a long and storied legal tradition.  You can\\'t just wave your hands while writing the names of a few philosophers and expect that to be persuasive.  To what extent did philosophers build America?  What about it couldn\\'t have been made, or made better, without them?  >There are absolutely methods for determining \\'good\\' and \\'bad\\' philosophy. Philosophers use logic and reason to differentiate between \\'good\\' philosophy and \\'bad\\' philosophy.  Name any thing that philosophy has produced, discovered or invented in the past fifty years.  Go on, blow my mind.  Give any major philosophical question and the answer to it.  List three points of Ayn Rand\\'s philosophy, show that they are wrong and why.  Really?  This changed your view?    >Can we answer high level economic questions without studying economics and math? Can we figure out plumbing questions without training in plumbing?  Of course not... Philosophy is so valuable!!!  Wait a second...  Do you know how to tell if you\\'ve answered a plumbing question correctly?  Is your floor wet?  Does water come out when you turn the knobs?  Congratulations, you\\'ve done it.  But what about when you\\'ve answered a philosophical question correctly?  Economics has rigorous mathematical formulations and you can tell when you\\'ve calculated correctly by measuring changes in the distribution of resources in the real world.  Philosophy does not even dream of approaching the same level of rigor and has no measurable impact that you can use to determine whether your philosophy is right or wrong.  >refined as any other field, isn\\'t it?  No.  Philosophy is absolutely not as refined as any other field.   Because you can not test your philosophies, you cannot improve them.  Because you cannot improve them, they remain unrefined.  The basic cycle of philosophy is, hundreds of years ago, some guy wrote some things.  End of cycle.  Ever after people read that philosopher\\'s works and bicker over the many obvious flaws.  Nothing ever gets refined, because while there is obviously a lot wrong, you cannot satisfactorily pick out what is right and what is wrong.  Later philosophers may publish new versions of older philosophical ideas, but these aren\\'t refined so much as they are mutated.  Refined would mean tested, purified.  Mutated is just changing some old ideas for your own.  >All our philosophical questions then may as well be answered by /r/showerthoughts or /r/trees.   Yes, they may as well, because they don\\'t really matter.  What is the meaning of life?  It doesn\\'t matter whether you read Dostoyevsky or the top post on /r/trees.  You are going to have to figure out what your life is about for yourself.  Philosophy has no verifiable insights about the world.  What is a good life?  The correct system of ethics?  How should we govern?  What is justice?  These are all fundamental philosophical questions, that, despite centuries of effort, are entirely unanswered.  As a challenge to philosophy: Name the biggest accomplishment in the past ten years for your field.  Fifty?  It is worth noting that no other field of study would have a second\\'s pause at listing their greatest recent achievement.  But philosophy will have to stretch mightily to claim anything that sounds the least bit credible.  > This isn\\'t to say I\\'m smarter - I just already know what arguments they\\'re going to make, why they might be wrong, what refutations exist, counter-arguments, what alternative views there might be, and even how points can be expressed differently.  >  Especially in philosophy if someone already came up with some line of thought 2500 years ago and it got thoroughly criticised/defended, its potential and nuances explored already.  let me add further to this line of discussion: suppose you are tinkering in your garage and you believe you\\'ve invented a brand new form of bridge-making technology that you think will revolutionize the industry.  if you take this to a group of engineers, they\\'re going to have a bunch of questions for you about how it works. if you don\\'t know their language, and how to answer the questions they ask, they will dismiss you as a crank. when you get to a certain point in most technical fields - especially as a tenured professor - you get *used* to random emails from cranks saying they\\'ve proved pi is a rational number, or that they made a perpetual motion machine, or they\\'ve discovered a proof of god.  now, if you have some super revolutionary technology and you build this bridge yourself, and now demonstrate driving a semi truck 50 meters over a structure made from three cartons worth of dental floss - then yes, that\\'ll convince people. unfortunately, there are no \\'holy shit\\' experiments you can do in philosophy. so you\\'ve got to get people\\'s attention and get them to think about what you\\'re saying. since _so many_ people are talking about these questions, and have for so long, you need to build a reputation. it\\'s like there\\'s been an ongoing conversation for thousands of years about these big questions, and the study of philosophy is not so much \\'learning to build a bridge\\', as it is \\'catching yourself up on what\\'s already been said.\\'  when you show up and say \\'hey guys, the nature of truth transcends language; its fatuous of us to expect to produce a set of statements that accurately and entirely describe the truth, as godel showed\\' - it\\'s like you jump into an ongoing conversation at a party and say \\'well wait, what are you guys talking about? i thought the weasel had boxer shorts?\\' - it does not bode well for your credibility.  the guy who drives the semitruck across the bridge made of dental floss is a mad scientist. the guy who says he could do this if he had a few million dollars is just mad.   imagine a group of people trying to figure out how to get into a cave. there\\'s a door on the cave. it\\'s got some kind of puzzle. there\\'s like 200 people in this group around the door, and they\\'ve tried all kinds of things. access to this door is limited, too - only one person can fit in the platform right by the door.  if you show up and say \\'hey guys i\\'ve been thinking about this thing, what if we tried X\\' - and they _think_ they tried X a hundred years ago and it didn\\'t work, but they spent about a decade trying it and it got them nowhere - they aren\\'t going to want to listen.  your odds of being listened to go up much higher if you can say \\'last time we tried X, we stopped right here because we gave up we believed Y told us X should have worked. that made sense at the time because we didn\\'t know about Z; model Z suggests doing X for just a bit longer might be sufficient, to account for this gap in our understanding of Y\\' - then they are more likely to listen. if you\\'ve been part of the group and talking with them for the past few years, reliably saying things they all seem to agree on - then they are more likely to listen to you. everyone has limited attention; people don\\'t want to waste it. sharing your pet theory is a lot more fun than trying to understand someone else\\'s.   you have to build credibility within any group. this is a well known fact among most people - and the fact that it\\'s not written down is why so many people won\\'t listen to strangers without social credibility talk about anything. if you haven\\'t been able to pick up the fact that  most people discard the opinions of strangers - especially if they make bold claims - they people figure you must not be that smart about philosophy, either.   if you want to engage productively in this kind of discussion, you must first build credibility and then make your claim in terms of the claims that have already been made. this is not because these claims are assumed to be true; basically all of philosophical history is \\'arguments which we don\\'t believe anymore\\' - they want you to make your claim in terms of past failed claims so that *they know you were paying attention* - because from their perspective, if you weren\\'t paying attention, chances are that you\\'re going to be like the hundred million other guys who showed up with a \\'brand new idea\\' that was proposed centuries ago, and people argued bout for a while, and did find some traction, until someone else poked holes in it and everyone started moving on.',\n '>What would the reaction from Americans be if someone walked through the streets of a predominantly black neighborhood saying \"I hate black people\" and was murdered?  \"What would the likely reaction be?\" is not the right question to ask.  You should ask \"what is the proper reaction?\" A person doing that is probably an asshole, but that does not mean that silencing him is a proper reaction.  And I think many people would care, because nothing you say should be enough to justify my shooting you.  The two examples you\\'ve mentioned are both examples of satire that have been forcibly silenced.  Satire is the portion of speech that always stretches the boundaries of what we condone because its purpose is often to be offensive as a means of highlighting truths about people or society that are difficult to address seriously.  In any case, I think you may have missed the point.  None of the examples you given actually hurt anybody.  They have only provoked reactions.  North Korea hacked Sony because they are so paranoid and insecure that they can\\'t stand their leader being mocked.  Some Muslims are so irrationally offended and self-important that they believe they have both the imperative and the right to kill people for drawing pictures.  Neither of these examples illustrate problems with the speakers, they show the unhinged reactions of listeners. Saying \"I hate black people\" is a clearly racist statement showing intolerance and prejudice. It is wrong because black people have no choice in the colour of their skin, and so insulting them for it makes you an asshole because you know that what you are mocking them for is something that they can never change and that doesn\\'t effect who they are.   Drawing Muhammad is not an inherently bad thing, because you are showing disrespect for a *belief* which can be changed at any point.  > North Korea hacked Sony because they are so paranoid and insecure that they can\\'t stand their leader being mocked.

Apple\\'s \"unibody\" chassis is almost impossible to repair. Aluminum is very rigid and smooth and pretty, but it\\'s not the most practical material.  Aluminum is Apple\\'s schtick. If you consider alumimum inherently superior it\\'s obvious Apple would come out ahead, but it is not inherently superior.  Furthermore, you don\\'t need power. At all. Business school doesn\\'t take power. You need an SSD, probably 128 GB, and 4 GB of RAM, but other than that it really is completely irrelevant unless you intend to use it for gaming or CAD work. So, something with less power, worse storage (HDD vs SSD), a *much* worse screen and a plastic case is comparable?  Come on, you\\'re sitting here saying that you can get better hardware for the same price without the brand name and I\\'m asking you to show that is the case.  And it\\'s not 170% more, it\\'s 71% more.  Huh FYI aluminum chassis are not the most silent, point 3 is moot You\\'re right, it\\'s an old version.  The current versions are 2.6 GHz and cost less than this one [on Apple.com](http://store.apple.com/us/buy-mac/macbook-pro?product=MGX82LL/A&step=config#)  Which means that it\\'s an even better value than the one I showed, which no one is able to provide a legitimately comparable hardware/price laptop. >Furthermore, you don\\'t need power  This is irrelevant to the conversation.  The question is whether or not apple products are worse value for the hardware.  No one has shown me that it is or is not. >even when I\\'m surrounded by more **powerful** or **capable** computers, I often choose to use my MBA instead because it\\'s so much **nicer** to use.  The former two adjectives can be objective, but the latter is almost certainly subjective. \"Nicer\" is pretty hard to pin down. I would personally be hard-pressed to consider something \"nicer\" than its more powerful, capable, and cheaper alternative.  The question then becomes: What areas do Apple computers compete in where they surpass their competition? >superior to non-apple options.  Superior to some. Non-Apple products run the entire gamut from $100 barebones laptops to six-figure bespoke machines that are never bought by individuals. I would challenge the idea that an Apple product is better built than its high-end non-Apple competitor.  You can get similar specs for half the price, but if you spend what you would\\'ve spent on the Apple you can get better specs and similar build quality.  OS ease of use is pretty subjective, though. Ease of use is heavily dependent on the OS environment you\\'re used to. What kind of functionality do you need that a $200 laptop can\\'t do?  At that range you are still going to be able to use your email, check Reddit, and watch YouTube.  I can\\'t imagine what else you would need for \"everyday use\" from a computer. Total miss on display quality though. It varies from model to model, but often, Apple computers are superior for personal use, value included, in the areas which they compete in. For $500, of course the apple laptop is the worse deal because it doesn\\'t exist. But I\\'d much prefer Apple\\'s $1000 laptop to other $1000 laptops *for personal use*. That\\'s partly because Apple\\'s $1000 laptop is a genuinely phenomenal machine - even when I\\'m surrounded by more powerful or capable computers, I often choose to use my MBA instead because it\\'s so much nicer to use.  On the other hand, I would not buy a Mac mini over a comparably priced PC desktop. The mini just isn\\'t as good for the price as the MB is. And indeed, I own a MBA and a desktop PC for those reasons. In their classes, each was the best value for me for that price range. It\\'s silent because it is fanless, since the chassis acts as the heat sink. Not going to link because I\\'m currently on mobile. Apple hardware is super overpriced. The 1499$ computer you linked? I could have gotten my 1179$ cyberpowerpc fang book evo upgraded to an SSD and 16GB RAM for the same price. My laptop has a 4 core i7, way better than dual core i5. And that\\'s while being 300$ cheaper. It also has a dedicated Nvidia 860M graphics card.  TBH, I am fairly biased against MACs because of the ridiculous price of their stuff for the hardware. But for a good reason.  The problem is that if I am spending that much money on a computer, I intend to use it for gaming.  If I have a separate computer for gaming then my personal use laptop will only need to do simple things like Reddit, email, and YouTube.  I can easily get a machine that can do those things for [$200](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-stream-11-6-laptop-intel-celeron-2gb-memory-32gb-emmc-solid-state-drive-horizon-blue/9195102.p?id=1219398344673&skuId=9195102) making a Mac ridiculously overpriced for the functionality. First of all, cut the hyperbole, it weakens your argument. You can **not** build a $200 laptop that has nearly the same functionality as a $1000 Macbook Air. $500-800, sure. $200, lol.  Even if you could, it\\'d be irrelevant. It\\'s like work boots. If I\\'m going to wear boots once a month, it\\'s sensible to get the $20 Walmart boots. Same functionality, 1/5 the price. But if I\\'m wearing boots 12 hours a day for the next 2 years, I want boots that are comfortable, reliable, etc. That comfort and reliability is worth an extra $100 or even $200 to, say, a handyman. Since I use my computer constantly, I want a computer that gives me the most comfortable usage. That\\'s what Macs are good for. That\\'s worth the extra $3-500 if you\\'re a power user, hell, it\\'d be worth the extra $800 if your price claim wasn\\'t ridiculous to begin with. (And, obviously, if OS X \"thinks\" the way you think, the way it does me. It doesn\\'t fit everyone, but for those that do, it\\'s well worth the coin.) That\\'s  >8GB of Onboard 1600MHz DDR3L RAM >256GB PCIe-Based Flash Storage  at the top of the page and   >128GB of flash storage, and 4GB of onboard RAM.  farther down. Huh? Furthermore, Apple doesn\\'t offer *any* Macbook Pros with 2.4 GHz processors.  That link is not correct. > What areas do Apple computers compete in where they surpass their competition?  Fit and finish, OS ease of use.  I love my non-apple stuff as much as anyone, but I know that the all aluminum MBP is as well designed and put together as any laptop out there.  The difference is in the hardware, which is usually lower quality per dollar.  But the packaging is, and has been for the last decade, superior to non-apple options. [This?](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Productcompare.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100006550%2050001759%2040000032&IsNodeId=1&bop=And&ActiveSearchResult=True&CompareItemList=32%7C34%2D259%2D724%5E34%2D259%2D724%2D06%23%2C9SIA5E62DH1881%5E34%2D100%2D326%2D03%23&percm=9SIA5E62DH1881%3A%24%24%24%24223%24%24%24)  The question is if the moderate increase in CPU, some extra ram, and graphics worth paying 170% more given that you\\'re talking more hard drive space in a component half a pound lighter? >  I would challenge the idea that an Apple product is better built than its high-end non-Apple competitor.  Look at the middle of the road MBP [here on newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA5E62DH1881)  And I challenge you to find a product for the same price that has:  1.

Reminds me of the \"evil people are intelligent\" thing that someone said   Edit: Delta for explaining how intelligence isn\\'t always good, I never considered how it could be not good. Less intelligent people exist for a reason.  Their genes survived through million of years of evolution. What is intelligence?  Is a great painter who is poor at math and science not intelligent? I know many people who are conventionally smart but lack social skills and can\\'t do art for shit. Yay fuzzy logic  \"well we don\\'t know *for sure* so I guess we can\\'t ever try or find out ever\"  Also, I don\\'t really understand how it\\'s *not* a better thing to be more intelligent. Like in any way. You can make wiser, more informed decisions to impact your future in a positive way.  Of course, we would also adjust the selection process to minimize \"unanticipated ways\" of diminishing our brain as we got better at figuring this stuff out. Intelligence ≠ Wisdom I\\'m still not understanding how a higher capacity for learning could be bad, or even just not favorable.  \"for a reason\" just means, their genes were clearly good enough to survive millennia, why start eradicating them now, not \"gad mayd every1, every1 has a purpos\".  If you start selectively breeding for intelligence you lose whatever characteristics allowed these individuals to survive.  \"the potential for generating ideas beneficial to man.\", will be less useful compared to ruthlessness and strength if we find ourselves in an apocalyptic situation. Perhaps our preparation is hindered by the stigma.  >for a reason   Lol. Too your other point: consider intelligence the potential for generating ideas beneficial to man.  > Also, I don\\'t really understand how it\\'s not a better thing to be more intelligent.  Human intelligence is responsible for the development of nuclear weapons, global resource depletion, climate change etc.  I wouldn\\'t argue that intelligence is a bad thing but you can\\'t claim that it\\'s results are universally good.  Ultimately what improves a species chances of survival are successful adaptation to the environment.  This may or may not entail becoming more intelligent. ∆   *sighs*   Yeah.   Edit: sennalvera points out how you shouldn\\'t toy with thinks like human life, which I didn\\'t consider much before my argument. That\\'s what the delta is for. also sennalvera explained the prejudices thing in a better way That\\'s not quite how fuzzy logic works. >What if we end up breeding in mental instability and don\\'t notice until too late?  What if our unguided evolution is adding mental instability or doing bad things to us?  >You \\'try and find out\\' with a new recipe or prototype engine design. You don\\'t \\'try and find out\\' with the human species.   The human species is more important than an engine design, so it would make sense for us to try and determine the ideal way of improving our species.  The proposal in the OP, to try and increase IQ, is obviously sub-optimal.  But it is a proposal written in a few minutes by an amateur meant as an example of how eugenics could be beneficial.  More careful, rigorous and researched proposals wouldn\\'t have the same deficits.  Cautiously proceeding with eugenics, in ethical ways, could limit many of the downside risks that we already face with unguided evolution, while expanding the likelihood that we can capture possible benefits. You \\'try and find out\\' with a new recipe or prototype engine design. You don\\'t \\'try and find out\\' with the human species. What if you\\'re wrong? What if we end up breeding in mental instability and don\\'t notice until too late? I may not be a genetically enhanced superhuman but I do know that our bodies and brains are a dizzyingly complex array of interconnections and balances. The brain is particularly poorly understood. Messing with it at our current level of knowledge would be insanely reckless.  >Also, I don\\'t really understand how it\\'s not a better thing to be more intelligent. Like in any way.  No, you don\\'t. As another commenter said, eugenics is vulnerable to our prejudices, and we\\'ve all been raised to believe that intelligence is unquestionably good. It\\'s part of our culture and from earliest childhood we\\'re urged to attain it. But if you could step into a time machine and ask people from different eras what the most valuable human trait was you might get some surprising answers. Many would say strength and courage; others virtue and piety; others duty and obedience. I think you need to step back and question your preconceptions. Can you give some concrete examples of problems that greater intelligence would solve?',\n \" That's not what he was saying. He was pointing out that several people here have changed views and I think he was trying to imply that this was evidence against your view. I'm not saying I agree with this idea but that's what I believe that comment is getting at.  If your view was changed, you should award /u/noplzstop a delta. I'll give you the ∆ on the waste of time point, which, frankly, was not so well worded on my part. It is fair to argue that even if OP does not change his mind, some people in the comments will. But I disagree with your first paragraph: just because deltas are awarded does not mean anything. As I said, controversial issues exist where both points are valid exist, and these posts are likely to dispense deltas liberally. The fact that deltas are awarded alone does not justify whether the time spent convincing a stupid person of a single point was time well spent. Delta here. I changed a view, noplzstop also, and somebody else on this thread changed two. > always something you can take away This is your mindset, but is highly antithetical to the mindset of most (ik, I'm using most again. Bear with me.). When most people lose an argument in the way that arguing with grandma can be considered a loss, they come away as frustrated, and even further attached to their opinions. Why? Because they feel as if they are talking to a wall, a stupid wall that cannot grasp the intelligence of the thought. This is why voters have a low turnout rate and every text post on /r/politics approaches maximum characters. People feel that it is harder to get into the minds of the others, and so, they respond by increasing the length, intensity of rhetoric, vocabulary, facts, etc., to the point that /r/politics text posts cannot even be considered to be true because they are so editorialized. The idea here is the same. Not all people take away positive things from an argument. >  The fact that deltas are awarded alone does not justify whether the time spent convincing a stupid person of a single point was time well spent.  I suppose I'll just have to agree with you there, but then again I'd argue that if you're looking for time well spent, Reddit probably isn't the place. I think it's kind of fun trying to change someone's opinion on a matter, especially if they're really stubborn about it. I know it's futile most of the time (e.g. arguing with my grandma about politics), but there's always something you can take away from any argument, even if neither of you are convinced of the other person's side. You might be able to refine your own criticisms of an idea or acquaint yourself with some argument against your view you haven't heard before. At the very least, you get practice dealing with stubbornness and stupidity, and that's good practice because there's clearly no shortage of those two attributes among people.   If you only think it's worth it if you convince OP of your view, you're right, it's sometimes just a waste of time. I just think there are other things you can gain from those kind of debates, even if you can't change their opinion.\",\n 'Your hypothetical situations don\\'t match up with my actual experiences. At my university (in Denmark) we operate with both \"formal preprerequisites\" (i.e. you must have taken this/these specific course(s)) and \"suggested background/academic qualifications\" (i.e. you should have knowledge in these areas). The former is rarely used, and usually only in situations where it would be literally dangerous to the students if they don\\'t have proven qualifications (e.g. if they are to handle dangerous equipment/materials/chemicals in a lab). There are also formal prerequisites on your secondary education for being enrolled into the degree program.  We don\\'t have a problem with people scores of unqualified students in courses. Consequently it doesn\\'t lower the level of the entire class either. At least not according to student evaluations and the teachers. Anecdotally, I\\'ve also taken many coursed and been a TA on a few, and none of them had the problem either.  Students know they\\'ll get slaughtered if they enroll in a class they\\'re not qualified for. The few people who do anyway just fail.  I\\'ve been vicechairman for our study board of mathematics and computer science for about two years. Some of our responsibilites are quality assurance and development of educations as well as defining the degree curriculum for educations within our area that are offered by the university. There is no data to support that we suffer from your hypothetical problems. As vicechairman, I also (along with our chairman) coordinate with the study boards for the other fields under our university\\'s Faculty of Science, and they don\\'t report having those problems either. Not only that, but if the class fills up with a bunch of students that are unprepared to take it then they take spaces that could go to students who *are* prepared even though there is a decent chance that they won\\'t pass it the first time and will have to retake it. This creates more demand for the class which makes it even harder to get into. Its bad for the students that are not prepared and its not fair to the students that are prepared but aren\\'t able to take the class because so many people are failing and retaking it. Often times professors have the option to waive a prerequisite if they think that the student is adequately prepared for the class in question through other means. This option has always existed. The fact that some professors choose not to use it is usually based on their own experience, observing how students without the prereqs do in their classes. While this may harm some high achieving students, as a general policy it also benefits all the other students trying to take the class. Its not a perfect system but its better than the alternative.  This already exists for a lot of courses. You just need to know the processes to do it. Each university/college picks and chooses how they will handle it though. Often times it involves going to directors of different departments and having meetings and filling out papers but in the end you take a test and if you pass it you get credit for the class. Now this is most common in mathematics and I have never seen this available for things that require labs but it never hurts to ask. The thing is this is not commonly known because most people can\\'t do it and with that knowledge most institutions don\\'t push the issue because it often leads to wasted time, money and discourages students. Prerequisites provide a standardized check and do not necessarily adequately prepare students for another future course (although they do in most cases). I don\\'t think students should gauge their own ability, but if they have interest in taking the course, another possibility to take it must exist (e.g. entrance test to see if they already have the necessary background) instead of of forcing them to take the entire prerequisite course. That is possibly just redundant, and both costly and time-consuming. ',\n ' And if we were invulnerable, we\\'d be even safer.  Yes.  &#8710; TBH, the fact that by this metric walking is more dangerous than driving blows my mind. I guess that it depends on where you walk? (Then again, the same is certainly true for driving.)  Maybe I feel more in control when walking, so I underestimate its dangers? It seems that you have made an excellent point here. Proving OPs point that cars are dangerous as fuck. The primary reason why all the others are worst than cars is because you die more when you get hit by a car.  Without cars, walking would be the safest way by far. Got me. I\\'m just using the data, or perhaps completely making it up.  Being hit by a car, muggings etc  You\\'re right.  The micromorts are calculated assuming that fatal incidents happen evenly distributed along all drivers. If you take into account that OP is driving sober and without an accident for 20 years, the risk is probably lower. I\\'d also like to see an analysis that takes into account the fact that exercise is good for you. It seems like it would be really trivial at first, but given how bad heart disease is in the USA, a little physical activity would extend the life of the average American. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if walking was a net negative mortality risk. Your username is quite fitting. It should be well within your skill set to get that data using Google and two words.  Well, I\\'m aware that Wikipedia has a bunch of references at the bottom of the micromort artlcle and that googling \"micromort\" gives a lot of hits. But I can\\'t be arsed to trawl through them. El Al is/was a state owned airline, that\\'s a bit different. They fly in an area of the world that is much more prone to hijackings than in western countries. Air Marshals are also federal employees and US airlines would be prohibited from putting their own armed security by the FAA on flights even if they wanted to. Yes, I understand.  The risk (as in percentage chance) of hitting a pedestrian while driving is not the same risk (as in percentage chance) of being hit by a driver while walking. What would be more fun for me? To say I made it all up if I didn\\'t, or to let someone use Google and think of two key words? I made the whole thing up. There\\'s no such measure as a micromort. But if there was, feeding rabbits would top the list of dangerous activities. Look at the bones! that\\'s clear, but his point was that micromorts might simply not be a good way to measure in this case. risk assessment could include your risk of causing harm in general, not exclusively harm to yourself. Well they are kind of fluke events and don\\'t happen very often. It also isn\\'t the fault of the transportation mode as a whole that they happen. Even if you add them in it\\'s still much safer than any other transportation method. Specifically the one of the most dangerous maneuvers that can be performed is what is known as a Rejected Takeoff (abbreviated as RTO) at V1 speed. This is due to the extreme heat generated on the brakes and the risk of a fire. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr4V680UQ-k The actor who is the CAUSE of realized risk is at issue. Very few pedestrians cause the death of themselves of someone else. Quite a few drivers of cars do.   Moreover, death is not the only risk associated with driving. There is also potential costs involving incarceration, civil suits, lost wages, injury, and so forth.   To presume rate of death is the one true measure of risk is taking a rather narrow definition of how most people use the term.  Your numbers are way off from the numbers I usually see, and I would like a source please. Unlikely, given all the articles and blog posts. I don\\'t know about you, but air travelling is not part of my everyday life. Hell, yeah it would.  > It\\'s a unit of risk representing a one in a million chance to die. To accumulate a micromort in a car, you have to travel 230 miles.  Can I get a source on this? More dangerous to who though? You may face less risk of fatality in a vehicle (cars have very strong safety measures in place nowadays), but by driving on the road, you pose a massive risk to cyclists and pedestrians. By getting rid of automobiles, you\\'d substantially reduce the per-mile risk of all other travel. Shouldn\\'t acts of terrorism definitely be counted? It doesn\\'t lower the risk of death by other drivers though.  Let\\'s not get too hasty with those deltas.  Most pedestrians (and cyclists) are killed by cars, after all.  So if you consider killing someone else by accident a \"risk\" of driving, then... basically add those values together if you want to understand how dangerous driving really is.  Unless you only care if you die, and everyone else can suck it... I\\'m saying that comparing the risk of walking to the risk of driving isn\\'t valid if you discount the risk that cars pose to pedestrians.  This is especially true because walking, as a complete alternative to driving, would be even more risky than walking normally, which is already \"riskier\" than driving. Discounting cars in a risk assessment, even if you are choosing to forgo cars, makes your assessment divorced from reality. The analogy presented is completely irrelevant to the situation, not to mention being a straw man.  The main threat to pedestrians is cars. The main threat to bikes is cars. Sure, but as an assessment of what style of transportation we should strive for, its not really relevant, since pretty much all of the walking an biking deaths are fairly obviously caused by vehicles.  This makes their base death rate, attained when they are the privileged method of transportation, very hard to measure.   US: 116 deaths per 1,000,000 people per year and 13,500 miles per year for average drivers --> 0.0086 is microhomicides/mile + micromorts/mile, so microhomicides per mile = 0.0042, roughly the same as micromorts.   https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate It can be pretty handy.  Since the whole micromort thing is based on statistics i meant the average risk of being hit by a car as one of the biggest risks when traveling with motorcycle, bike or walking. Most people who are walking do that in cities and not in some forrest so the average risk of being hit by a car is way higher than being attacked by a bear.  OP said that \"Driving a car is insanely risky and probably the most dangerous thing you do in your everyday life.\" and I\\'d say that even the other means of transport presented here as more dangerous only are that dangerous because there are people driving cars. Therefore this doesn\\'t really contradict OP\\'s argument but in a way supports it.  What do the dangers of being outside have to do with any of this?  > Also while we may disagree that being hit by a car is one of the bigger risks, I assume we agree that it isn\\'t the only risk.  Obviously when I say that it\\'s \"one of the bigger risks\" that implies that there are others. How is walking more dangerous?  What are the risks? The possibilities of a fender bender or small accident involving a car are relatively high.  However, it\\'s almost never fatal for drivers in cars.  Small accidents involving cars and pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists are much, much more deadly for the latter groups. I\\'m from the UK too, them statistics are scary man. But fuck it, life\\'s short anyway!  You should know full well driving a car is not the most risky thing I do. Riding a motorcycle is the most risky thing I do. \"Probably\" doesn\\'t enter into it, as I\\'ve already stated I ride a motorcycle.  No they really aren\\'t. The airlines don\\'t screen passengers for security, they just issue the tickets. It is the TSA and government that performs security screening and it is the FAA that sets the regulations on what security measures must be followed. The only thing that an airline has a responsibility to is for the security from the crew members themselves. But I think they do a good job of this. I can\\'t remember the last time an airline crewmember brought down a plane. That\\'s true, but disease is a different animal than accidents involving machinery. I feel like it\\'s better to compare vehicle deaths to dangerous industries like oil digging, or coal mining. They\\'re the result of our transportation industry/policies and so are more solvable than heart disease or cancer, say. > The risk of a walker being hit by a car is not equal to the risk of a driver hitting a pedestrian  Hmm, well, it must be in one sense... but I see what you mean since there are fewer walkers than drivers.  All fatal accidents are fluke events.  Airlines are responsible for security. I\\'m not talking about hypotheticals; I\\'m talking about point of reference. If you want to define risky as \"fatal for the driver,\" then sure the point stands. However, if you consider the sentiment of the argument rather than the semantics -- i.e. driving is risky because there\\'s a lot at stake both in terms of your life as well as that of others -- then it becomes a more subjective point of debate. You wouldn\\'t add those values together.  The risk of a walker being hit by a car is not equal to the risk of a driver hitting a pedestrian. I understand what you mean but it\\'s still micromorts, a chance to die, not financial problems. From the computer in my car that tells me my average speed. You may have noticed I used myself as a reference point. I have in no way spoken for anybody else\\'s experience.  The risk is very low since most bears are great drivers. Except [this one](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1620933/y3C5t.gif). Ok let me rephrase it: Although the risk of dying while driving is lower than the risk of dying while walking, the overall risk of dying involving someone (yourself or someone else) driving a car is higher than the risk of dying while walking/riding your bike... without any car involved. This makes me say driving a car really is very dangerous (just maybe not only for yourself). Just explaining since you were interested. I\\'m nice like that. I\\'m right there with you. Keep two *on* the road, sister or brother.  Ok, well in the case on 1 you need to determine how much you value the risk of hurting someone else compared to the risk of hurting yourself and add the risks together.  Then you can compare that combined risk to the risk of walking.  I don\\'t know that anyone in this thread has done that properly. [From a wikipedia source](http://understandinguncertainty.org/micromorts) We\\'re on the internet.  Use it. Air travel? Thank you, this answers my critique perfectly. No, those don\\'t have an effect on the risks of driving or riding in a car.  I think OP is right, it\\'s incredibly more dangerous than people think it is. There were [33,561 vehicular deaths in 2012 in the US alone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year).  We\\'re a first world country and have that kind of death toll on the roads.  We overhauled our entire security/privacy/transportation sectors to protect against terrorists who killed 10% of that number one time in 2001.  We have an equivalent death toll to 9/11 every 4-6 weeks on the roads in the US and nobody says a word about it.   I think OP is absolutely right that it\\'s an under-feared danger. That\\'s fair. The primary point I was pushing was 1) so feel free to disregard the last sentence in my original comment if that makes things more coherent. > the risk of dying while walking/riding your bike... without any car involved. This isn\\'t a real world situation. How? Just how? Are you saying you can\\'t die without any car involved? Trying to make an analogy imagine this answer in a discussion on the question if having a gun is dangerous: > the overall risk of dying involving someone (yourself or someone else) *using a gun* This is a real world situation. > the risk of dying while walking/riding your bike... without any *gun* involved. This isn\\'t a real world situation. And that\\'s where you are comparing the real world with a hypothetical one. We live in a world where people *have guns*. The risk of dying while walking in a world without *guns* is an irrelevant comparison. Everything you can do has some level of risk associated with it. For *having a gun* to be \"insanely risky\" it would need to be riskier than the real world alternatives, which it isn\\'t. You have not mentioned microhomicides associated with each mode of transport though.  I would think most of the deaths while walking or biking are caused by cars, so individually you might be safer driving, but as a society if people avoided driving we would all be much safer.   Air travel makes for good missing airliner 24 hour news coverage but 2014 actually had fewer air fatalities than most other years in the last 2 decades. The most dangerous part of any flight is your drive to and from the airport.  http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/transportation/comparing-fatality-risks-united-states-transportation-across-modes-time  > Excluding acts of suicide and terrorism, commercial aviation was the safest mode of travel in the United States, with 0.07 fatalities per billion passenger miles: “A person who took a 500-mile flight every single day for a year, would have a fatality risk of 1 in 85,000.” (One variable to note: Takeoffs and landings are where the risk is, not in the number of miles flown, so risk-per-flight calculations are higher.) What do you mean personal insurances? Like home insurance?  That\\'s a separate point.  There are two arguments here: 1) The risk of hitting someone is still a risk - I agree with this, although I fear that the statistics will be misused in measuring this risk, as they are being misused all over this thread. 2) Walking is only risky because of driving. If nobody drove then it would be less risky - This might be true, but it is irrelevant.  We live in a world where people drive.  The only thing OP can control is whether s/he drives or relies on another mode of transport. The latter is what I\\'m talking about. In any case someone should be responsible for airline security.  My original point was that I don\\'t see a reason to omit terrorism related airplane deaths if it represents an actual risk of flying.  Calling it a \\'fluke\\' doesn\\'t make the victims less dead. In Copenhagen, the average bike speed is 9.6 mph on a normal bicycle. I was referring to average bicycle speed, a better measurement rather than being based off of one particular person. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_performance That\\'s great. Read my post and tell me where I used a micromort to make a claim about an average user.  It is probably not more dangerous - the info is probably wrong. It\\'s based on a wiki article which is based on a weird animation which is not based on anything as far as I can tell. I\\'d assume being hit by a car is one of the bigger risks when you\\'re traveling with one of the other options so it kinda shows the argument of OP to be true. To add, think of bing hit by a car while in another car vs being hit by a car while walking. Cars have safety systems in place to protect the people inside...where as being hit from the outside provides no protection.   Mind you, not all car accidents kill or even injure severely for that matter. Or maybe I just made up micromorts and am just screwing with you. There\\'s really no way to be sure.  Then feel free to give your data on microhomicides.  As far as you know. Look around, maybe there\\'s tons of safe fun you\\'re missing out on. On the micromort bandwagon. 1.4 cigarettes and a .5 liter of wine is actually equal risk to that my 230 mile car ride or 17 miles walking. Anyone who consistently smokes even a little is at way way higher risk than driving. Unless I\\'m on a long, non traffic light place, and on flat land,  5-7 is pretty reasonable. Yeah but the driver most probably wont die. Not saying it\\'s a good thing, but we\\'re talking micromorts here, so you\\'re still safer while driving. the micromort does only calculate the risk for the people inside the car. If killing someone with a car is also considered a risk, then driving a car might actually be the most risky thing of these alternatives.   Seeing your risk measures for passengers and bicyclers makes you wonder how they die (mostly in car accidents, I presume). So driving a car is probably the most dangerous thing you do in your everyday life for you and your fellow human beings. The statistics, presumable, are based on total number of miles driven, which would average properly over all speeds, or on hours driven, where a driving speed is assumed. OP\\'s position is about the world we live in, not some hypothetical world.  \"There exists a hypothetical scenario where non-driving is less risky\" is not a good rebuttal to \"non-driving is risky.\" Here\\'s some data that suggests riding in a car is significantly more dangerous than you estimated (and affirms OP that it\\'s a dangerous endeavor relative to other transport):  >Lifetime Odds of Accidental Death (Source National Safety Council)  - Bicyclist 1 in 4,838     - Car Occupant 1 in 242  >Leading Causes of Accidental Death in the US (As compiled from data reported by the National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 50, No. 15, September 16, 2002)  - #1 Motor Vehicle - #6 Drowning - #9 Other Land Transport Accidents (including bicycling, walking, etc.)  >Fatalities per Million Exposure Hours (Data compiled by Failure Analysis Associates, Inc.)  - Motor vehicle travel: .47 - Bicycle travel: .26  [Source](http://overthebarsinmilwaukee.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/fear-mongers-be-gone-riding-a-bike-is-safe/) Well airlines still have their own security policies.  El Al for example is said to have 3 plain clothes armed air marshalls on every flight and is one of the safest airlines in the world. That\\'s excellent. But I was more referring to the unnecessary sass and hostility. Feel free to do whatever, though, I guess. You too pal The article also indicates that eating and having a beating heart are more risky than riding a bicycle, which contradicts the OP\\'s assessment that driving is an \"insane risk\". The numbers are completely made up. I invented micromorts as a ruse. Or not. Some adrenaline-inducing activities may be statistically safer than others, even if you can\\'t perceive the difference subjectively in the heat of the moment. We live in a world with cars, though.  OP is discussing personal risk. Then feel free to give me an accurate number of the OP\\'s micromorts for driving.  Oh, *now* you\\'re aware of all the sources. Interesting.  It would be awesome if you just made all that up. Although it\\'s not that big of a risk for your own life when you hit someone I\\'d still say it counts towards the risks of driving. If you only compare the risk of dying for yourself while traveling driving is safer than walking. But since the title says \"Driving a car is insanely risky and probably the most dangerous thing you do in your everyday life.\" and the biggest danger for people traveling with other means is being hit by a car that makes driving pretty dangerous. That\\'s true if you don\\'t consider other risks to the driver. Prosecution and legal costs are costs, so from a perspective of economic risk they are considerably higher than for a pedestrian who is not likely to kill anyone if they bump into them.  I disagree. He is keeping that on the road and more or less under control while the whole vehicle is on fire. While he is no Jason Statham, that\\'s damn impressive! If you\\'re going that far - being alive is a risky thing. Think of all those bacteria on your skin, in your skin, travelling through body.  Think about how many of those bacteria are dangerous, and how you\\'d be suffering if you didn\\'t have an immune system. Think about (before medical tech) how many babies died from just *being born*.  This is why families had 13 siblings, cause half of them would die before they hit a couple of years old. Just being alive is more dangerous to you than driving a bloody car. We\\'re also a country that has over 300,000,000 people in it. More than 2.5 million Americans die every year. Those that die in car accidents are 0.001% of the population. 30k plus looks like a lot, but not compared to the population. 600,000 people a year die from heart disease. That\\'s a 9/11 every day and a half.  Personal experience isn\\'t relevant for a statistical issue though. I thought it was common sense that car crashes are a major cause of death for pedestrians but of course common sense is just as irrelevant for a discussion as personal experience so I did some googling and found [this](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6215a1.htm). I think this supports that while walking may have a higher micromort per mile rate than driving it would actually be safer than driving if you don\\'t count in deaths caused by drivers. Hmmm, for the USA there were [33,561 traffic deaths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year) for [4,274 billion passenger miles traveled](http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_40.html) in 2012. That\\'s 127 million miles per fatality, not 230 million.  However, I think this is counting pedestrian and motorcycle deaths, and also truck and bus travel, each of which would shift the number in different directions. It does seem hard to get an accurate number, but 230 seems a bit high to me too.  Unfortunately, when I click through for your source\\'s source, it\\'s 404. I wonder if the difference is just UK vs USA. Relax, yo. As a motorcycle rider... Shiiiiit He\\'s talking big about your average cyclist, as opposed to you specifically  /u/MageZero provided it. The page you cited used 40 mph, but that just means you\\'re comparing apples to 0.8 apples. I didn\\'t ask you to do anything. You\\'re doing this by your own choice.  Replies are also unnecessary, and I see you\\'re feeling free to do whatever. Wikipedia What is the risk of being killed by a bear driving a car? How many micromorts!?! But if there were no cars on the road, the numbers for walking would be much better, so it kind of shows how cars are dangerous. Other than being hit by a car, I don\\'t see what is dangerous about walking. > the overall risk of dying involving someone (yourself or someone else) driving a car This is a real world situation. >the risk of dying while walking/riding your bike... without any car involved. This isn\\'t a real world situation. And that\\'s where you are comparing the real world with a hypothetical one.  We live in a world where people drive cars.  The risk of dying while walking in a world without cars is an irrelevant comparison. Everything you can do has some level of risk associated with it.  For driving to be \"insanely risky\" it would need to be riskier than the real world alternatives, which it isn\\'t. The point was that walking is more deadly on average than driving a car. I\\'d say walking in a world without cars would score lower on the micromort scale than driving a car in this world does. My conclusion from that chain of thought is that the argument of other types of transport being even more risky in this world loses its weight if you think about it. I agree that walking still would have risks but the risk to harm yourself and others (like the people walking) when driving a car is far higher. I think you\\'re relying on that one misleading wikipedia article. A bunch of the information there is wrong/misleading. Please don\\'t perpetuate wrong information and then refuse to provide sources.  Here\\'s a source that says there are about 0.6 fatalities per million hours driven, most of which are occupants of the car: http://www.meretrix.com/~harry/flying/notes/safetyvsdriving.html  This suggests a micromort every 2 hours of driving, not 7. I don\\'t understand the source the wikipedia article relies on - as far as I can tell those numbers are made up. On the other hand, the source I linked to explicitly derives its numbers. >33134 fatalities/(2.9x1012 miles driven)x32 miles/hourx1,000,000 micromorts/fatality = 0.37 per million hours driven. Where did you get 32 miles/hour from? As for the bicycle, it would be 1-2 hours, 10 to 20mph is much more average that 5-7 mph This point, combined with the fact that the risk is not only to death but injury and incarceration. In most states, if you run over a pedestrian, even if they don\\'t die, if you\\'re at fault you can face significant costs which are risk though they are not risks of death.   Driving being safer, *but* walking being more dangerous? Those are the same thing... A lot of driving also takes place in scenarios where pedestrians aren\\'t even present, whereas very little pedestrian walking takes place in locations that cars don\\'t access.  I\\'ll be honest though, that particular complication might not matter depending on how the statistics are gathered. I didn\\'t actually know that! How much did it go up by if you don\\'t mind me asking?  Neither of these are a danger of walking though, it\\'s a danger of being near cars, or in dangerous locations.  A person in a wheelchair could have both of those things happen to them just as likely. Do you have sources for those numbers?  I feel everything I\\'ve read suggested you\\'re safer on a bicycle per mile vs a car. So what? I was using myself as an example. You may have noticed I didn\\'t make the claim that *my* micromorts were universal.  I assume these statistics are mostly based on US-oriented studies. I don\\'t have the figures off the top of my head, but it\\'s vastly safer than any of the others, as are trains.  My blood pressure is currently 117 over 76. I don\\'t really don\\'t know what else you want from me.  What is the source? And how, exactly do you know how fast **I** ride a bicycle? I find it interesting that *you* think *your* data on me is better than my own.  He could be a risk analyst for insurance.  Those guys are paid to take it that far.  Do as you will. I enjoyed your post about risk assessment, but I looked through your post history and you seem like a massive dick.  It\\'s possible that you don\\'t care what people on the internet who you will never meet think about you- in that case, do your thing. If that was not your intention, I thought I\\'d let you know you know. If that is your intention, then I replied because you are playing a part in turning a sub that I enjoy for its discussion style into a hostile environment. I would like to prevent that if possible, but it\\'s not like I can stop you from doing anything. So replies are unnecessary in the \"air, water, food\" sense, but necessary in the \"I don\\'t want this sub to suck\" sense. >My blood pressure is currently 117 over 76. I don\\'t really don\\'t know what else you want from me. Was funny sarcasm to me.  >Replies are also unnecessary, and I see you\\'re feeling free to do whatever. Was in response/defense to how I replied to you. >That\\'s great. Read my post and tell me where I used a micromort to make a claim about an average user. Was just pretty dickish to a presumably well intentioned poster.  That is my reasoning, but like I said before. Do as you will. Yes, but when you consider an activity \"dangerous\", it\\'s valid (essential, maybe) to also consider the danger to other people.  That doesn\\'t follow. The riskiness of anything is derived from the risk associated with the actor.  In this case, the fact that one of the risks of walking is being hit by a car has no bearing on the risks of driving. How do you know it\\'s wrong/misleading.  It seems like you\\'re just choosing to rely on different statistics that have, as far as I can tell, the same level of veracity.  Also, very basic math here,   33134 fatalities/(2.9x10^12 miles driven)x32 miles/hourx1,000,000 micromorts/fatality = 0.37 per million hours driven. I wish I\\'d had these numbers when I was discussing safe driving practice and the pedestrian\\'s right of way with some jackass on this sub.  pedestrian killed every 17 million miles, atrocious. Sure, but those aren\\'t the only two options. You could find things you love to do that don\\'t expose you to vastly increased risk of lethal injury.',\n 'What could possibly go wrong with that plan?',\n '> we should never criticize anyone for anything even if we perceive it as bad (or criminal).  There is a significant difference between criticism, which can range from constructive to rude to destructive, and shaming, which is not only destructive but must also carry a significant amount of weight to qualify. Additionally, the exception for criminal acts is based both on the distinction of it being an action and the harm that laws are (ostensibly in some cases) designed to prevent.  As such, to state that we should not shame anyone for possessing an immutable trait is not to say that we cannot criticize, nor is it to say that we cannot shame them for actions clearly delineated as destructive. Personally, I\\'d also contend that shaming criminals relies on the justness of laws, of which we have many contradictory examples. > a lack of empathy often leads to direct or indirect harm to others.  A lack of empathy does not equate to antisocial or sociopath like behavior. > Not sure why OP is picking out one thing in particular  Personal experience, mostly. > You can argue that almost anything is an \"immutable trait,\" such as prejudice, tendency towards violence, crime, etc.  >Are you saying we shouldn\\'t criticize people for being tactless, shallow, petty, greedy, selfish, or prideful?   The major difference between these and empathy is that they are much easier to change. For example, a child who has never been exposed to sufficient emotional information will be unable to develop the neural networks necessary to process it. This is evident when comparing children raised in environments where emotions are frequently being acknowledged and discussed or not, and also children who have been neglected. Although training can improve it somewhat, if they are too old they will basically never be able to process emotions normally. Often they suffer Alexithymia as a consequence as well. Or, much more likely, it\\'s because our standards don\\'t mesh.  That\\'s generally not a bad thing and I\\'d say it only becomes one when some of us try to force one standard.  We\\'re a diverse species and even among those that agree we will see rather noteworthy differences under closer scrutiny. > There is a significant difference between criticism, which can range from constructive to rude to destructive, and shaming, which is not only destructive but must also carry a significant amount of weight to qualify.  Perhaps this is a case of semantics, but here \"shaming\" is being used as an active attempt to elicit shame and criticism being taken to the point of an attempt to elicit shame rather than stopping at pointing out a flaw (whatever form that may take). > prejudice  That stems from a number of inaccurate assumptions and is cultural, not innate.  > tendency towards violence  That however, is innate (if memory serves).  Would you shame someone for that?  I mean, I could have a tendency towards violence and rarely actually *be* violent, but I could frequently have the urge.  Would that make me a bad person?  > It seems that the logical extension of your view is that we should never criticize anyone for anything even if we perceive it as bad (or criminal).  Not really, (though I *do* hope to have a conversation not far from that one at some point...) it\\'s more that one should not be criticized when they forget to put in the mental energy necessary to actually care about a topic the way some others do because they haven\\'t actually done anything *wrong* other than not go out of their way for someone else. My response here is generally \"I know why it *can* be bad, but why was what I *did* bad?\"  That usually creates something of a loop of \"It\\'s bad because it\\'s bad or could be bad.\" > You don\\'t think humans are innately prejudiced?

For the same reason we don\\'t consider it okay for people to criticize others based on some of their values (here\\'s looking at homosexuality and the religious right).  I suppose it also depends on what you mean by \"right to criticize.\"  If we\\'re talking about you saying \"You\\'re being so apathetic!\" and they respond with \"Yeah, that\\'s because I don\\'t care.\" Have they done something wrong there?

That said - it doesn\\'t make things easier, if anything, it makes things harder to simulate, no? But once you simulate a human brain, it doesn\\'t need to find out how it works on its own, you can simply feed it the information, at which point it can modify itself. Although the ideas for modifications would probably come very slowly (slower than academia?)  positive results, in mice, in one area of intelligence, without properly looking at all the myriad side effects. It is very easy to be over-enthousiastic about this stuff, pumping chemicals into your brain isn\\'t exactly easy, safe, or well understood you know. Nootropics already exist, and there are reasons they\\'re not standard issue for everyone. What? \"I think, therefore I am.\" \"Thoughts go in, words come out. You can\\'t explain that. You can\\'t explain that.\" - Bill O\\'Riley Human brain simulations have the same cognitive and intellectual limitations as humans. If a human can\\'t come up with modifications to itself just by being given the right information, neither will an simulated brain.   Also, such information isn\\'t available right now. Like I said, we know far too little about the brain in general.  To clarify:  You think that the physical act of surgery (where to cut, etc.) is by far the hardest part of enhancing intelligence?  I agree that modifying code makes for a better scalpel(-equivalent), but I don\\'t think that that\\'s what\\'s holding us back. We know a lot more than we used to, but we\\'re still nowhere close to understanding how cognition arises, how neuron networks precisely work to control our mind and physiology, how they\\'re wired together, and a whole host of other issues.   I\\'m not saying we don\\'t know anything about the brain. I\\'m saying we don\\'t know enough to amplify its cognitive and intellectual abilities even in simulation.  This is a fairly large leap of faith given that there are entire components of our brain that we have no idea what they\\'re used for in human beings.   Moreover, even those regions of the brain we understand well in terms of what functions they are involved with, we have no idea HOW they work. There is no model that goes from \"here\\'s a bio-electrical signal passing between neurons\" to \"And here\\'s a thought that appears in the mind.\"  We have no idea how the brain works at any level. Pick up any neuropsychology journal and you\\'ll see that we\\'re still struggling with basic questions about nearly every micro and macro level question you can imagine with regard to the brain and cognition.   Source: Psychology student  You seem to miss the point. Even if you could scan every cell in the brain; and produce that cell in some random state on a matrix that replicated all the neural connections;  that gives you far less than what is necessary to have a functioning brain.  > No human, or even group of humans, even begins to understand how the brain works. Any neuroscientist will tell you this.  This statement is incredibly faulty. The truth is that we know *a lot* about the brain. Although we are very, very far from understanding it completely, we know a great deal about how it works and what areas are responsible for which things. Saying we haven\\'t even begun to understand it is a complete lie. I don\\'t know what profession you are in, but if you have at all studied neuroscience you should be aware of the immense information we have about the brain and its functions.   Edit: in terms of improving the brain, we could potentially be able to do so using drugs within the nearest five years or so, as it has recently been tested in mice with positive results.  >If a human can\\'t come up with modifications to itself just by being given the right information, neither will an simulated brain.  Of course it can. It\\'s a simulation after all. Just change a few bits. Maybe not the brain itself, but certainly an external being could change the brain.  Plus, human brains can change themselves, sort of. It\\'s called evolution. And evolution in a simulated environment would be several order of magnitude faster. The idea doesn\\'t depend on already knowing anything about the brain at any level. We could know absolutely nothing about the brain and still be able to scan it. What we can scan we can render and in the case of a brain accurate rendering would produce cognition. We still wouldn\\'t understand any better, but we (unethically) or the AI (ethically) would have a platform for proper experimenting.  Scanning tech improves constantly. It used to be that we couldn\\'t see sperm and then one day we could and then eventually we made it someone\\'s job to count them.  You would have to scan the brain at the cellular level. Which can not be done effectively with living brains currently. But regardless, a scan gives you the cells, but not the neurotransmitters or neural state. You could therefore only scan half of what is needed to have a functioning brain. But that ignores the point that scanning an entire brain at the cellular level is simply not something we are capable of doing right now. We\\'re deep in the process of trying to figure that out.   Moreover, and far more problematically, the brain is highly dynamic. We know that even in older people, dendritic spines grow and decay at a fairly high rate. We have no model to explain why or when that happens. The same is true of glial cells. So even if you could scan every neural and glial cell, you have no idea how those structures are changing; how those changes correspond to mental representation, effect or event; or even how or why any particular neuron is activated at any one time. Voxel-based mophometry  studies show us that brain volume is dynamic as well, though we don\\'t know what the volume changes are caused by (though they are correlated to learning events but not to knowledge, oddly enough).   The notion that we could produce cognition based on our current quite limited understanding is nothing short of fantasy. Dumping a bunch of biochemicals in a black box and flipping a switch doesn\\'t give you a working brain.    Close enough, yes. A scalpel and a lot of time and willing subjects. For the first step we don\\'t need to produce a radically better brain just a better one.  Human brains *learn*, but so far we haven\\'t learned much about the brain, and I\\'m not sure a simulated would learn about itself any better.  As for *evolution*, that requires many generations... so we\\'d effectively have to create hundreds of thousands or millions of random brains to see which one is doing better than the others. Not impossible, but 99.9% of random mutations in evolution are *terrible*, so it would be a long trial/error process (though with enough computation, it might not be unreasonable).  But this still brings up the ethical issue of what is effectively human testing and potentially human torture and murder (messing with people\\'s brains, and \"deleting\" them after we\\'re done). you just mentioned that we are nowhere near biological enhancements, then you claim that a virtual brain would be able to improve it, when it hardware gets adjusted all the time, thus a better precedent exists for increased hardware ans software rather then bettering an emulation of something we hardly understand Vision is everything. There is a difference between testifying that there is nothing to see and testifying that you see nothing.  I\\'m not saying the mind is magic. It\\'s a physical machine, but an enormously complex one. We know a lot about it, but there\\'s also a lot we don\\'t know about it. One day science may reveal the brain\\'s mysteries, but in the near future, we won\\'t know nearly enough to understand how to modify a brain to increase its cognitive ability. A human brain could design a better version of itself if it had the hardware to safely implement the changes in experimentation. A virtual brain wouldn\\'t need hardware or the risk of surgery.  Increasing the size of certain portions of the brain is not necessarily going to improve cognitive capabilities. There\\'s really no evidence for that. We\\'ll need to know a lot more about neuroscience before that becomes clearer.  So you speculate. And even if you are right it is not the death knell to this happening but merely a technical hurdle. History is filled with seemingly insurmountable technical hurdles being overcome, and what you point out hardly seems \"insurmountable.\" Yet. Wouldn\\'t the simulated brain be a person? What if the consequences are negative? Wouldn\\'t that be unethical? > As for evolution, that requires many generations...  Epigenetics have actually demonstrated that certain genotypes (and thus phenotypes) can be differentially activated depending on environmental exposure, and that this plays an important role in the genes that are transferred onto the next generation. Hence, two people with equal intelligence who use their brains differently will not be equally as likely to have intelligent offspring. Epigenetics basically goes against what we have traditionally learnt about evolution, but it has received quite substantial support in a very short time.  A brain whose existence was virtual could experiment by multiplying the portions of brain matter responsible for cognition. It would be experientially dicey, but not quite so bad as monkeys trying to find Shakespeare. The results of a few educated guesses at what optimizations could be helpful would create a new vista of possibilities for the mind at work.  Oh, it is about the most exciting thing in the world of science at the moment. [Here](http://www.nature.com/news/fearful-memories-haunt-mouse-descendants-1.14272) is an article about one study who found mice offspring to be able to inherit fear of cherry blossom and [here](http://ki.se/en/news/long-term-endurance-training-impacts-muscle-epigenetics) is another about how long/term endurance training affects skeletal muscle metabolism in offspring (if you are interested).   > That said - it doesn\\'t make things easier, if anything, it makes things harder to simulate, no?  In all honesty I don\\'t really think this would have too much of an impact in the immediate environment. As such, we would (hypothetically) still be able to simulate a brain without taking this into account. However, if we want to simulate a brain that operates exactly like a real one, we have to consider the whole biology of the body as well.  Why do you think \" a human cant come up with modifications to itself just by being given the right information\"? If researchers currently don\\'t understand 100% of brain function, you can\\'t say that humans can modify their own brain because no one can be \"given the right information\" yet.  Also, obviously human brain simulations have the same cognitive and intellectual limitations as humans. That\\'s why I said  >Although the ideas for modifications would probably come very slowly (slower than academia?)  Since any ideas for a modification come from a single person instead of multipole research groups. And why do you care about what\\'s available right now? This is a hypothetical situation. Obviously if we can digitally simulate a brain at some point in the future, we will understand hwo it works.   Sorry to come into your fantasy bearing facts. Continue to assume that reality has no bearing on your statements.  > A human brain could design a better version of itself if it had the hardware to safely implement the changes.  This is simply not true. No human, or even group of humans, even begins to understand how the brain works. Any neuroscientist will tell you this.  The brain would be a person and for that reason I believe it would be unethical. But being unethical has only sometimes delayed things historically.   The consequences could be negative or great. Either way as the tech gets easier to handle it is inevitable.   The trick of it will be to raise an ethical person within a controlled environment. But we don\\'t know how to do that, or monarchies would be great. ',\n \">I fail to see how the labor market is any different from another commodity.  The labor market has a regulated price floor, which you yourself advocate. If i don't like the price of a pack of gum, I can buy it elsewhere without a legal minimum. If real wages are constant due to inflation then there is no real growth, if there are nominal rigidities then there is some, that's the idea of monetary expansion, in part.  >what prevents business owners from raising their prices to account for the additional money in everyone's pockets?  Competition. If you raise your prices and your competitor does not then you will loose business. It is as always a matter of margins vs volume.  This is very true and it was a bit of an overstatement to equate labor with all commodities. Gum isn't the best example because it is a polymer compound which doesn't have a recurring fixed maintenance cost.  A better example is certain crops or livestock. While a producer may temporarily flood the market and be able to produce something at below the cost of production to help drive out competition over the long term they will eventually run out of money to engage in this kind of market manipulation.  The big difference is unlike people livestock aren't eligible for public tax provided benefits. Competitors coming into be able to undercut other players is good thing. It encourages innovation and keeps costs down. In the US inflation is actually lower than we'd hope.   And while you are right that this would cause a self filling cycle, it is not an infinite one.  When the minimum wage goes up prices go up as well, but not at a 1 to 1 ratio. The money that goes to higher wages is taken partially from less pay to owners, less product being bought and forcing employees to be more efficient. Undoubtedly business owners would raise prices, that's always what happens anytime you introduce more currency into a system.  > The thing is, there isn't a one-way relationship between prices and wages. They all influence each other in many different ways. Thats what unions are for, historically, to be able to control the prices of the labor market.  Exactly and the biggest driver is monetary policy. Even though costs would get pushed higher through wages if I can't get a loan to open that second location or have to pay a high interest rate I will be deterred from doing so. This will reduce demand and help keep inflation in check.  The thing about unions is there are many cases in which they have actually backfired. Strong unions created such high costs that it lead to outsourcing to countries which didn't have that problem.  > I am personally against minimum wage completely, as I believe it actually hampers the labor market.But you did mention in the OP that this is a discussion you don't want to get into.  Yes exactly. It's not that I don't care about people's responses to this it's that I believe it will be a distraction from the the idea of auto adjustment. I don't actually objectively know if it it hampers the labor market or not, it would be very interesting to read the economic research about this. You're looking for the Fischer equation n=r+π What you are referring to is the idea of [cost-push inflation](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/012005.asp), which is an increase in the cost of production factors causing a decrease in the aggregate supply.  Wages are just one of many factors in inflation and aren't really even the largest one. Businesses still have to deal with adjusting prices from almost every other commodity as trades occur in the market. I fail to see how the labor market is any different from another commodity.   Automatically adjusting wages would create some inflation but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. A small amount of inflation encourages people to spend money instead of saving it which spurs economic growth. Keynes best described this as the paradox of thrift where saving money hurts the economy.  The Fed would still have plenty of other tools to control inflation not the least of which is the interest rate. Recently getting the inflation rate to go up has been much harder than bringing it down.  Full disclosure: I'm not an economist either but am interested in economics.\",\n 'The entire point of social safety nets (like welfare, food stamps, section 8 housing benefits, social security, etc.) is that they are given to people who are truly impoverished and/or those who are unable to work. If someone who makes minimum wage is truly impoverished, then they should be eligible for social benefits in the first place. If they make minimum wage and are truly impoverished, then that is most likely a sign that the minimum wage is too low. I took economics, I\\'m aware of it, but it doesn\\'t really change the fact that even if you remove the 1% from the equation:  -The poor you were trying to help (and those on fixed incomes) are paying more when they were paying nothing before.  -Everyone else is probably paying the same, unless they refuse to shop at Walmart anymore, in which case they are still paying more because other merchants charge higher prices. Although that\\'s another problem with providing social safety nets. They need to gradually fade out as you rise out of poverty, they can\\'t just cut off. Otherwise it\\'s a disincentive to earn more. This:   >I took economics, I\\'m aware of it, but it doesn\\'t really change the fact that even if you remove the 1% from the equation:  And This:  >-The poor you were trying to help (and those on fixed incomes) are paying more when they were paying nothing before.   Don\\'t go together. The poor were *not* paying \"Nothing\" before. in fact they were paying a lot.  Food stamps are paid for by the government through taxes. Some of those taxes come directly from the bottom 40% of income earners (about 10%). So right off the bat they\\'re paying 10% of the price of those food stamps (because money is fungible).  The remainder of taxes are on things like income, capital gains, inheritance and payrolls. These are not *directly* paid for by the bottom 40% of income earners. *But they still pay for those taxes through higher prices*. The exact same mechanism that, in your eyes, passes the burden of a minimum wage onto low income and fixed income people (prices) also passes the burden of capital gains taxes, income taxes, corporate profit taxes etc... Not *all* of the burden is passed in either case, but a fair amount of it is.  Are they, on balance, paying more than they were before? Definitely not. Why? Because everyone making minimum wage got a raise. Everyone making just above minimum wage probably got one as well. Everyone who shares a household with one of these earners got a raise. These people are overwhelmingly (for obvious reasons) low income earners.  *Part, and only part* of that raise is cancelled out by higher prices. The remainder is borne by others: shareholders, high income earners, suppliers who get, respectively (over the short/medium-term), lower dividends, lower incomes and lower prices. By taking econ I meant macro and micro it wasn\\'t my major  And yes the min wage workers get their raise partially erased in the short run and completely erased in the long run. If it wasn\\'t they wouldn\\'t keep raising minimum wage.  Also those on pensions, disability, retirement and unemployment did NOT pay taxes before if their earnings were below a certain threshold. They now will pay more for goods though. So the truly impoverished,  those unable to work, get hurt the most. ',\n ' But is it just? How can we treat that Boston bombing kid with a trial but these guys with bullets and bombs? As we are functionally at war with Al Qaeda and military courts do not have juries, merely a panel of higher ranking officers, I belive that we could forgo the jury. However with a jury would that make it ethical?  Additionally a military intervention to capture the suspect could also lead to collateral damage. The alternative to a drone strike is not merely a trial but a team being sent in to capture the suspect as well. I belive that is equally if not more likely to cause unintended casualties. I will try to find statistics on that but currently don\\'t have any in front of me. I\\'d love to see the statistics that show that covert ops teams cause more collateral damage than drones firing Hellfire missles. The problem is that the \"active planning to commit an attack\" reason is up for unfounded speculation and fabricated evidence (WMDs anyone?)  \"They refused to hand over someone we considered (but had not proven) guilty\" is also a poor standard for justifying a war. Would Saudi Arabia have been justified to invade Denmark for nor handing over the Cartoon artist? Would Italy be justified in invading the US brcause the US is not extraditing the CIA agents that illegally anbducted an Italian citizen to be tortured? Is Iraq justified to invade the US because they are harboring the war criminals who started an illegal war on fake evidence and violated the Geneva convention?  If you start arguing the right to go to war based on refusing to hand over suspects, you\\'re walking on very thin ice and into a lot of grey areas. What about attacks in [Somalia?](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/world/africa/drone-strike-is-said-to-kill-shabab-leader.html) Are we at war with Somalia then? Or [Pakistan?] (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan) I am not trying to address justice, or fairness; you initially claimed that the attacks were illegal, as well as futile. I think I\\'ve refuted the first half of that claim.  That said, I\\'m unclear why you think that there is a right to a trial for non-American citizens engaged in active warfare against the United States. Is this just? I don\\'t know - but countries are generally considered to have a responsibility to protect their citizens. The United States has decided it has a responsibility to its citizens to protect them and treat them fairly. This responsibility includes a trial when they are accused of terrorist attacks, but military action when they are attacked by an external enemy.  All those groups are affiliated with Al Qaeda, AUMFAT literally means that Congress granted the president the authority to combat AQ and groups affiliated with AQ by any means necessary.  So, it is *not* illegal. And futile? Al Qaeda is a shadow of its former self. So I hardly doubt the campaign against AQ has been futile. Well, sorta yes.  We\\'re certainly engaged in acts of war with Somalia, Yemen, and Pakistan.  If their governments want, they would have casus belli to declare war on the US.  It would be stupid for them to do so, so they don\\'t. If the requirements for calling a drone strike included a judge signing off on the fact that there was enough evidence to be sure the person to be taken out was guilty of or planning a capital crime would that be enough to be considered just? > We declared war on Afghanistan after the attacks, when they said they were not handing over the people that attacked the US.  Technically it was an \"[Authorization for Use of Military Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists),\" not a formal declaration of war. That hasn\\'t happened since WWII. Thank you for clarifying.  I\\'ll note that this distinction is semantic and legal, not substantive. We fought the Vietnam War, not the Vietnam Authorized Use of Military. Similarly, we were at war with Afghanistan. Judges generally don\\'t get to execute people by themselves,  a jury is needed.  Furthermore, drone strikes can cause collateral damage whereas a typical execution cannot.',\n 'My title does seem focused on guidelines but my argument takes a much harder stance if you choose to read it. The guidelines part came from seeing countless news videos of situations in which lethal force was used and seeing cops just standing around waving their guns. Drawing your weapon should be an actual last resort, not the go-to in any tense situation. If you are not focused on guidelines then you posted poorly and should repost with an accurate title.  > Drawing your weapon should be an actual last resort, not the go-to in any tense situation.  You do realize this is a straw-man argument, right?   There have been lots of police officers discussing gun issues on reddit in light of the current events. Every single one of them has said that they were trained that using their gun was the absolute last case scenario. Only if the officer felt that they or another member of the general public were in grave danger was it permissible to use their gun.    ',\n 'But that\\'s just a trick of semantics.

Its still opinion. relative. temporal. fleeting.    like art, a high-res photo of saturn is just as beautiful as molecular structure of excrement.   meaning and morals are laid plain.   Ghandi. Hitler. Osama.  bin Laden. MLK.  All men making their own meaning in the world.  \\'We make our own meaning.\\'  aka There is no meaning, so we all make stuff up living the delusion that anything matters. We share the same thoughts. Meaning is assigned subjectively by individuals, there is no ultimate meaning, anymore than there is an ultimate meal. As Dr. Seuss said, don\\'t cry because it\\'s over, smile because it happened.  Consider all the people that came before that contributed to the great ribbon of existence. How many generations it took for us to reach the level of knowledge, technology, and sophistication we have today. All those who died did not leave nothing, they left everything, and we continue to pick up those parts and make our own Lego set.  If you only consider the solipsistic view of existence, meaning can seem facile, but considering that we are all part of this grand existence, we all contribute to it, to ourselves, and to each other.   A drop of water is not the ocean, but the ocean is made up of drops of water. The group cannot exist without the singular, and the singular can be made greater when seen in the whole.

Because if so - you will need to explain such a view because I simply don\\'t understand it. So what? Why would the next step in civilization be regarded as anything more majestic than another ring around saturn.  That logic doesn\\'t solve the issue,  it just chooses to dodge the prevalent reality of nihilism.    > No value to the person experiencing that temporary thing.  It has value to them while they are still alive. Who cares about whether it has value to them after they are dead?  > Because that person dies and it then is as if nothing ever happened.

It\\'s like you\\'re pretending that it didn\\'t happen, and I don\\'t understand how you can come to that conclusion. it realizes futility.  it\\'s a game that has no end and the rules don\\'t matter. What is the meaning of \"ultimate meaning\"?   This sounds like a pun, but is actually a serious question.  An action has \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" if you perceive it as an useful step towards reaching a goal. A limited lifespan imposes a bound on the goals that you can reach and thus on the meaning of your actions.   But if you could live forever what difference would there be? Any goal you reach you still reach it in a finite time. How could you have an \"ultimate goal\"?  As other people pointed out, if you lived forever as a human, or even as cyborg or as any physical system of finite size, your memory would still have a finite capacity, because [you can only store so many bits of information in any finite region of space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound).   But even if you could somehow defy this physical limit, what would be the \"ultimate meaning\" of your continuous accumulation of memories? How can nothing mattering be a reality when there is no objective measure of meaning or mattering?  Whether something is meaningless is purely a matter of human perception and construction. We ascribe value to things or we don\\'t. It\\'s not anymore a reality to say all lives are \"meaningless\" than it is to say the world is \"good\" or \"bad.\" It just is. You\\'re the one putting labels on it. If you don\\'t value things that aren\\'t permanent, than we can\\'t prove to you that they\\'re valuable. It seems like a strange way of looking at the world though. Why would you measure meaning by some ever-moving endpoint instead of by the space in time where the actions took place?   It seems like you measure what has meaning by what you can take with you, so to speak. Whether you, personally, will have something to take away from the action or experience. If this is the only way you can measure meaning, then sure, at the end your life will have been meaningless. You\\'ll cease to exist and to you it will be like you were never born. But is that the only and the best way of deriving meaning? I think it would be rational to end your life if the rest of it would be only pain or so much pain that it outweighs everything else. That\\'s why I\\'d say suicide can be the right option if you are in the last phase of a terminal illness. The problem I have with most people saying such things is how could you know for certain that the rest of your life would be more pain? But when you die, you live in people\\'s thoughts and memories. That sounds super cheesy right now but if you take it literally, it\\'s not the same as you forgetting what u read in a book.',\n \"Pay information is one thing, which shouldn't be saved by the company anywhere, but certain companies want certain information.

You forget that a lot of these groups out there aren't after land, but rather attempting to simply destroy other group's ideals or bolster their own.  MAD doesn't save us from people like this. Even if they aren't particularly enamored with territory, using force to bring about their ideals generally means competing with others who would use force to eliminate their group. Control of territory removes this threat and allows them to enforce their ideals within that territory. The threat of a nuke holds the other force at bay. The use of the nuke will usually fail to fully destroy the other force and invites it to attack.  The difference between a nuke and a terrorist attack is that the terrorist attack has to be demonstrated before being treated as a credible threat. It has no power without at least a one-time implementation. The nuke is a credibly proven threat by the simple proof that one possess the nuke. Possession of an ICBM delivery vehicle increases the threat greatly, but isn't strictly necessary for it's existence. All of this is why territory is only part of the equation. Prior to attaining a solid and defensible territory, the group is substantially vulnerable. The ability to threaten with a nuke to accomplish a defense of their group or even gain concessions from once-enemies is a great boon to such a distributed group. Territory provides other options with which to obtain these things by force, and is the only reason it must be considered. > Hypothetically there's nothing to stop a non-centralized fringe group from using a nuke in a terrorist plot if they could ever get their hands on one.  A non-centralized fringe group that has sufficient organization to get hold of nukes should have at least one person level-headed enough to realize that the threat of a nuke is worth more than the visibility of having used one but no longer possessing such. After a fairly short period with access to this threat, any capable group would have territory of their own to defend and would fall under MAD.  This doesn't mean that the threat of a nuke being acquired by such a group is not substantial, just that it is unlikely to manifest in the actual usage of the nuke. I think you're vastly overestimating the value of territory to some of these groups.  That, and just because a group controls a piece of territory doesn't mean that they actually hold a claim to it.  Example, if ISIS were to nuke the US or Israel that doesn't mean that we'd be able to respond with a counter nuke of ISIS territory since Iraq, Syria and other actual countries still claim ownership of those regions.  You can't nuke ISIS because that would royally piss off the actual countries who claim sovereignty over those areas.  You're also forgetting that a lot of these fringe groups are highly mobile and spread out.  Take AQ for instance, they've got strongholds in several countries in several of the Stans, Yemen, Iraq, etc.  So if they coordinated a nuclear attack on the US where exactly are we supposed to retaliate?  They're simply not concentrated in one easy to invade area.  Heck, I would be willing to bet that if we nuked every known stronghold simultaneously that they'd still have a few that we don't know about operational.  These groups just don't operate like states.  You simply can't retaliate against them like you would against an actual state. The problem is that MAD only applies to states and not individuals or groups of individuals.  Hypothetically there's nothing to stop a non-centralized fringe group from using a nuke in a terrorist plot if they could ever get their hands on one.  You can't give a canoe head to someone who's head cannot be found.  Or at the very least, if you did know where their head was it's unlikely you could return nuclear fire if they were located inside another state you're not prepared to declare war on. I didn't see OP's argument as being that he disagrees with the idea that the chance of nuclear weapons being used by anyone at all is extremely low; rather I think he was making an argument against essentially MAD without really mentioning it.  As for addressing his argument that individual psychopaths who have infiltrated nuclear weapons control teams could fire off the nukes - this misunderstands the nature of psychopathy. A psychopath may want to instantly kill millions of people, but the rules of MAD still apply. Psychopaths are extremely self-centered and knowing that they would probably die as a result of firing the weapon would be enough to deter them from doing so. They are also very intelligent and would know this before joining the program, likely choosing a different path to fulfill their urges.  Additionally we have to remember that psychopaths make up 1% of the non-prison population in the US and the majority of them never become violent.\",\n ' > \"god doesnt exist/cant exist\" (atheism) You seem to use the term atheism as synonym for hard/strong atheism, at least that\\'s what your example suggests. Atheism does however also contain soft/weak atheism, which only rejects the belief that a god exists. The belief that no god exists doesn\\'t necessarily follow from that. Let\\'s use an example: Given a coin-flip with a unknown outcome to all parties, you could argue the belief that the coin turned out heads. So headists would state \"It turned out heads.\", hard aheadists would state \"It didn\\'t turn out heads.\" (and it therefore follows that it has to be tails) and soft aheadists would state \"I\\'m unconvinced that it turned out heads.\" (but he may also be unconvinced that it turned out tails!) In general it is sensible to default atheism to weak/soft atheism, since it is the common ground of both positions. (as in, hard atheism is a special case of soft atheism) I think this is the best argument; sure the primary religions may die off. But that doesn\\'t mean new religions won\\'t be created in their place.  Where did OP say that religion would \"completely disappear.\" He argued that religion is \"still in society\" because of childhood indoctrination. I think you\\'re being remarkably unfair with your interpretation of \"still in society.\" Until there is definitive proof as to what created the universe (yeah, I know, the Big Bang - what came before that? Where did everything originate?) people will believe in some form of divinity. As well, some people would probably find it more likely that a deity created life than it just happened by chance. The question of \"what came before the big bang\" is a sort of odd question; considering there wasn\\'t exactly \"time\" before the big bang. Being agnostic doesn\\'t answer the question as to whether or not you actively believe that to be true.  If I told you about the invisible pink unicorn that smells green hovering over you right and asked if you believed in it, *you would have to claim agnosticism*. Are you agnostic?  If no, then you need to reevaluate how you answer the god question. You can be unsure if something is real, but also currently believe that it is or is not real.  \"I don\\'t know if Snowden released the information out of the goodness of his heart, but I believe that he did.\" \"I don\\'t know if god exists (agnostic), but I don\\'t believe he does (atheist)\".  In my POW this is an important clue to understand why we still have religions. Many people (if not the vast majority) needs some kind of god/explanation so that everything \"makes sense\". This is why we have a vast variety of religions that all seeks to answer questions regarding the meaning of life and death as well as our origin. Also this is the reason why so many people say they are religious even though they do not strictly follow all the rules of the \"traditional\" religions. Simply because they need something to believe in that is greater than themselves. I never implied that there was. Sometimes people don\\'t need some kind of divinity to explain how the universe was created, but to have something to rely on if everything else fails or to know that their life does have a sense to it.   I know. So what caused it to happen?  Personally, I\\'m agnostic more than anything else, but I can totally see why people believe in a higher power simply for that reason. What set everything in motion?  People are still creationists, it won\\'t be enough. Humans are stubborn.  To me when OP says \"still in society\" there\\'s a connotation of prevalence. One wouldn\\'t say that pedophiles and other deviations are \"still in society.\" People will continue to believe in religion long after there is definitive proof. If the search for meaning wasn\\'t engrained into you as the pursuit of a religion then I think more people would be interested in science as it would seem to them to be the most rational search for meaning.',\n 'Exactly, OP standards for a form psychosis would probably encompass 99% of people Ahh, in that case, I agree with your agreement. > By religious fundamentalist, I am referring to someone whose personal religious beliefs are obsessive and interfere with one\\'s ability to think rationally (e.g. someone being a creationist or belief in a need to \"save people\").  This is not the same as being \\'wrong\\'. However, I do agree with that \\'Given the environment they grow up in, their beliefs are perfectly rational\\', but I don\\'t think that is what OP is referring to either. Being a fundamentalist is taking a step beyond your average religious person into blatantly denying anything inconsistent with your world-view regardless of any obvious logic. ~~Although I do think that OP may have confused fundamentalism with actual psychosis. Someone believing they receive messages from god would still be considered deluded, not fundamentalist.~~  Edit: I misread OPs last part of the argument and therefore my last line was incorrect. I mainly agreed with you though. Apart from the part about \\'being wrong\\' as it didn\\'t really relate to fundamentalism per se. As I cited, OP said \\'By religious fundamentalist, I am referring to someone whose personal religious beliefs are obsessive and interfere with one\\'s ability to think rationally (e.g. someone being a creationist or belief in a need to \"save people\").\\' Apart from this, I agree.

The atheist has been following the local weather reports, looks at the sky and says, \"Well, looks like science was right again!\" The fundamentalist has been praying hard for rain, looks at the sky and says \"Wow, praying really works! Guess the priest was right!\"  The problem I have with your analogy and I think its possibly the same as the OP, is that none of your analogies have repeatable results (which is kind of the basic block of the scientific method.)   The Atheist in this one is able to look at past weather patterns, and the available meteorological sciences, test and retest the results and use science.   The Religious man cant look at any of that. He can try and apply science to his prayer but will find it falls short.   The \"religious beliefs are obsessive and interfere with one\\'s ability to think rationally\" part from the OP I think is talking more to a religious person holding the belief that god parted the Red Sea, or a man lived in a whales belly, the earth is only 6000 years old, things that due to science we know could not be true.

It\\'s a bit like quantum mechanics and relativity - I understood them well enough to use the relevant equations in school, but I my brain never fully \"believed\" it.  You are missing a huge thing about fundamentalists; they will find a way to rationalize it. Sometimes the rationalization is based on bad information, but it is still a rational belief to them. Take a look at [Answers in Genesis](http://answersingenesis.org), and you will find otherwise intelligent people going through many hoops to rationalize their belief.   The idea that they can\\'t think rationally hinges on their comprehension of science. You essentially take the word of scientists for your understanding of the world, and they take the word of other trusted figures for theirs. Picking the wrong figure to trust is not a mental illness. >Life accidentally forming out of muck sounds more realistic.  I suspect that that would be because you grew up being told that \"reality\" is that life accidentally formed out of muck. > I suspect that that would be because you grew up being told that \"reality\" is that life accidentally formed out of muck.  Actually quite the opposite.  I was raised to believe that evolution was a scam being perpetrated by Satan to trick people and that a literal interpretation of Genesis was the only correct option. > You essentially take the word of scientists for your understanding of the world,  Exactly. And in isolation, trusting scientists and their research/publications is just as irrational as trusting a TV preacher or priest.  When people are asked to trust something based on the person\\'s *authority*, you enter quite a grey zone...  The OP defined fundamentalist as:   >e.g. someone being a creationist or belief in a need to \"save people\"  I think based on this definition, my reply stands. >many of the beliefs are inconsistent with observation or self-inconsistent. Rational thinkers reconcile new information with older information  This is very often not true. And it\\'s not exclusive to religious people at all. People cling to beliefs all the time. People are more likely to recognize evidence that confirms what they already thought or want to be true, it\\'s conformation bias. Imagine being told something your entire child hood, then you get out into the adult world and you\\'re supposed to just logic your way out of it? People don\\'t work like that. The usage of empirical evidence (contradictory information) presupposes that the person exposed to the evidence is an empiricist.  Most religious people are not empiricists when it comes to spiritual questions.  For instance Pope Francis agrees with evolution, but that doesn\\'t shake his belief in God.  So perhaps he\\'s a quasi-empiricist or a \"God between the gaps\" type who puts God in there somewhere if there\\'s some kind of gap of info as to how things came to pass The point I am making is that you cannot subjectively define logic and rationality, as it is based entirely in the absence of such; just as I cannot subjectively define what a meter is. A meter is a meter regardless of my opinion of it. This is not a circular argument.   Edit:  > Yes, science is rational to those who follow science, but the whole point is that we aren\\'t talking about from a scientific perspective.  As rationality is based on scientific principles, it does not depend on whether you follow it or not. A gallon is a gallon regardless of whether I use the imperial measurement system or not; just like logic will forever be defined the same regardless of whether *you* adhere to its principles or not.   > it\\'s conformation bias  And just to add to that: it effects everyone and is just a part of the way the human mind works. >Religious people pray all the time, and since rain (or other things) generally eventually happen, they have very high \"success\" rates. [...]  Then he runs into an atheist and says \"look, Priest Joe told me to pray really hard and it will rain. I worked really hard, and it rained. How can you just ignore that evidence?\"  He would have to pray and then be able to predict the outcomes for this to be anything other than self fulfilling prophecy tho, wouldnt he?    >if, after a lecture on atoms, his college professor tells him that the oceans contain imadethisupspecium, he\\'d probably believe that too. Why is that very different from accepting what an experienced scholar with a large following says about religion?  Peer review, and repeatable evidence. He can make the claim that any number of things are in the ocean, if hes making that claim with zero evidence none of the peers will be able review and accept his claims, making them simply claims. ',\n '>I see no reason why it can\\'t.   Then you are ignorant.  >Technology improves at an exponential rate  No it doesnt  >Computers get smarter and smarter and one day computers will make better computers  No they wont. and no they arnt.  Computers arnt any smarter than they were 40 years ago.  Hell you computers dont even have a measure of smartness.  >Even now some computers can program themselves better than we can program them  No they cant. Maybe they can modify themselves in way that the developers defined.  >And when it happens is irrelevant.   >One day it will happen  No it wont, anyone who says something will happen for certain, is certainly wrong. This assumes linear growth of technology, when in fact technology may actually grow more or less exponentially. 80 years in the history of humanity is nothing. 300 years of industrial revolution is nothing in the history of trade. That\\'s a misapplication of the theory.  Machines are not people or nations.  They do not have a finite amount of time and labour.  They are manufactured on demand.  If they are better than us at everything there is not something we can switch to.   I watched the video before.  He just said that automation is replacing humans in many parts. He did not ever explain why it\\'s bad. >Agricultural advances allowed people to move into other fields of work.... Automation makes it to where you don\\'t need people to do things. It\\'s no longer a multiplication of the human\\'s labor, it\\'s the removal of the human element from the equation.   I would argue that automation is similar to agricultural advances.  The jobs that people moved to from agriculture simply didn\\'t exist beforehand.  People would have viewed the agricultural advances as removing the human element from the equation.  Similarly, automation will, by removing the need for unskilled labor in manufacturing, allow people to move into new fields. > that might indicate that automation is forcing people to work longer hours for less pay,   Automation isn\\'t doing that, society is doing that. Society began with the idea that everyone working together and contributing to a pool of labor would allow everyone to get ahead collectively. As such, what you contribute to the pool of labor is essentially your value to society, whether that be through picking up and putting down heavy things, inventing, fighting off other societies, entertaining others through art, etc.  As we reach post-scarcity, that correlation starts to dissolve. We don\\'t really need everyone to work as hard as possible anymore. However, as a society we know of no other way to value people, so we create busy work for them to do.  The most apparent example is that politicians are constantly talking about \"jobs\" as if they\\'re important, when all that really matters is quality of life. We\\'ll throw quality of life down the drain in order to create jobs just so we can say people are employed, even if they\\'re doing absolutely nothing productive with that employment. Yeah I hear these arguments. But they ring hollow to me in certain ways.  Economists are not engineers. Economists are sometimes wrong. Economists do not all agree.  I get the history of the luddites and the industrial revolution.  But in many ways I think humans are horses. They are monkeys. They are at best advanced computers. They are not gods. They are not essential to markets.  Economic laws do last forever especially in changing environments. The industrial revolution is a short period of time.  Who knows maybe automation will create some new utopia.  But its arguable industry and science gave us industrial genocide, world wars and the nuclear stand off.  I am utterly resigned to technological advancement but I recognise that it could go very wrong. yes. That\\'s what I\\'m looking for as well.   My entire argument was in hopes that someone would suggest that we wouldn\\'t need jobs any more.   Thanks for making that happen. I think this is a great point. Never before was the world economy interconnected in so many ways. Look at our economic recessions. It\\'s going to get more deeply connected and if one thing falls, it\\'s have a deeper and wider affect. Good or bad. This is what I\\'m worried about automation for jobs. >I think you\\'re underestimating automation. It\\'s not just manufacturing. It\\'s transportation, retail, customer service... Even creative industries. Programs can already make compelling, original music.   And none of these fields individually have as large of a fraction of the population in them as agriculture did.  And automation will have little impact on the creative fields. Automation is useful in most fields because it is cheaper and more efficient than hiring a person. In the creative fields, however, the only important factor is quality of the final product, I.e., it\\'s ability to sell.  People won\\'t buy a cheaper song just because it\\'s cheaper, they\\'ll only buy music they like.  Thus, the chief advantage of robots over people is nullified in this field.  Sure, you may see automation in certain creative areas, writing jingles, advertisements, etc., but robots won\\'t replace people altogether in the creative fields on their price point alone. They do indeed have a finite amount of time and labor. Your machine can only be doing one thing at a time, and there are only 24 hours in a day. There are also only limited resources available for building machines.  And none of that matters. If a machine can make $20 widgets A for $10, and $20 widgets B for $15, then even if humans can only make widgets B for $20, and sell them for $22, everyone in the situation is still better off if people make B\\'s and leave making A\\'s to the machines.   No matter how many machines you have, there will always still be things that machines are *more* efficient at than *other* things that the machines could be doing. Humans can do those things... they might only be able to make a small amount doing them, but it\\'s still economically more efficient. Automation is a lot different than previous developments.   Agricultural advances allowed people to move into other fields of work. Industrial advances allowed people to make more things, faster. Computers allow people to do more things, faster. Automation makes it to where you don\\'t need people to do things. It\\'s no longer a multiplication of the human\\'s labor, it\\'s the removal of the human element from the equation.  COP Grey has a pretty great video on this Humans Need Not Apply: http://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU You wouldn\\'t see increasing unemployment at first, you would see declining wages as the bargaining power of labor decreases relative to capital.  It is only when humans lose the ability to bid on work at all you would see unemployment permanently spike, and I don\\'t see that happening for at least the next 30 years, which is to say I have no idea.  I would, however, expect a gradual reduction of wages over time across the economy followed by a sudden and lasting spike in unemployment.  Some few jobs will pay much more while most jobs decline in pay.    In the distant future, maybe the \"invisible hand\" will see to it that we prefer to have humans perform certain tasks over machines for a time. But just as with international trade and nationalism, the hand will fail. >Sure it is still a multiplier. The ratios change.  Well, when the ratio is one mcdonald\\'s with a bunch of robots and a two managers with experience in troubleshooting software and no other employees, that\\'s not changing a ratio, that\\'s removing an industry.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' [data](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12005054), it\\'s actually at the same point as when they started counting in 1976.  Furthermore, that\\'s working hours for *employed people*, but what concerns us here is working hours *per capita*; if you cross it with the data from [this table](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat01.htm)¹, you\\'ll get a decrease. Not quite as dramatic as predicted by Keynes, but still a decrease.  ¹ It still doesn\\'t include children under 16, but it\\'s arguable on which side should students be counted anyway. I don\\'t understand your point. When machines are better at everything what are people going to trade? >those hours are more weighted towards leisure and away from output than they\\'ve ever been before.  I wish I worked in a field that was based on work done instead of hours worked. :-/ The difference is in the scope of jobs being replaced - not just manufacturing but even intellectual professions, including writing, analysis, finance, medicine... Many people today probably would believe that a computer doing a doctors job would be closer to science fiction than fact, despite the fact that it\\'s already real. And while other jobs develop to replace those automated, the rate of job creation will not always outpace job loss. That\\'s what OP is concerned about (me too), and you haven\\'t addressed that.   It\\'s also worth noting that our longer hours are a symptom of economic inequality, not a failure to automate more work. You can\\'t just assume this casualty you\\'re implying.  Here\\'s the problem.  CGP is not an economist.  He *thought* he was making a video about technology, but he actually made a video about economics.  Thus, he didn\\'t spend any time at all on the economic theory, and he, um, got literally everything wrong.  I like CGP, and I like his videos, but this video illustrates the problem with trusting \"public intellectuals\" who comment on a wide variety of topics.  CGP would have been well-served by citing a few economists, cause they would have saved him from some embarrassing mistakes.  When this video was posted to CGP\\'s subreddit, /u/NakedCapitalist posted an economically-informed reply, and CGP never bothered responding to it.  If you want to see, in detail, what CGP got wrong, I\\'d recommend you [read it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey/comments/2dfh5v/humans_need_not_apply/cjp7pk8). > Automation still needs setting-up and maintenance, you\\'re not taking the human completely out of the equation. You cite computers, yet they are a form of automation as well.  Right, but look at the difference.  Prior to computers you would employ a file clerk, a secretary, and an accountant to do what the computer does.  One excel spreadsheet does the work of an accountant in significantly less time, for a fixed cost of one week\\'s pay for the accountant.  With phone answering systems, dictation software, wordprocessing software, etc, that\\'s another job replaced at the cost of a month or two of pay.  File Clerk?  Windows has a search function, and you don\\'t have to pay nearly as much to electronically store the files (even if you\\'re paying for a data back up facility).  What used to be about 20 jobs for a smallish company working in a white collar field have now been displaced, and replaced with... what?  3 jobs in IT?  15% job replacement rate isn\\'t sustainable.  > Will the solution of the past (just do something else) keep working or not?  No, not really.  The jobs in the production of making our lives better have been replaced steadily since the industrial revolution (for the relevant country).  The automation revolution (which history will say we\\'re in the dawn of) will push everything to the service economy, a transition that was observed as having started under Reagan.    The problem is that a service economy is completely unsustainable without input from outside sources.  A Barista quite simply cannot afford to get coffee from another barrista often enough to keep all barristas employed, especially when a computerized espresso machine gets to the point where it can replace a starbucks employee.   To see examples of this, take a look at any tourist town.  Alternately, take a look at any town where the major industries have fallen on hard times.  The Rust Belt, for example, or Detroit.  See, the problem with Automation is that it\\'s going to, eventually, hit *every* major industry.  It won\\'t be a question of exporting Steel jobs or Manufacturing jobs... it\\'s going to be a question of replacing basically *all* jobs.  If machines can replace us in making most of what we do... as jobs become more tenuous, people will be more careful about what they do with their money, meaning that the machine made cup of coffee that costs 50% but is 90% as good as the human made one will become the preferred choice, thus putting even barristas out of jobs... > The economy readjusted, and the automation gains contributed to increased standards of living for everyone, in the long run.  I find it weird how common and emotionless that view usually is. It\\'s a bit like saying that all you need is a good holocaust to weed down a population and get rid of undesirables, and you\\'ll then have increased standards of living for everyone in the long run thanks to the redistribution of wealth and land.  CGP\\'s point was that automation is different this time.  I mean, automation has been happening for as long as jobs have existed, millennia, but all of a sudden it\\'s about to change, because robots will be better than humans at literally everything.  /u/NakedCapitalist is pointing out that a) that\\'s ridiculous, and b) even if it was true, there would still be jobs for humans.  \"Starting a conversation\" is only good if you know what you\\'re talking about, and CGP doesn\\'t. Agriculture automation... is automation, though, right?  Like it\\'s not some other kind of \"advance\", it\\'s the same kind of process that\\'s been happening in other areas?  You\\'re establishing a false dichotomy.  Multiplication of human labor in all these instances has been based on the removal of the human element from [some part of] the equation - often a large part.  As often as not, in fact, the human element is [completely] removed in the same way as in any contemporary automating process, e.g. it is altered entirely, from [doing thing] to [maintaining the machine that does thing/network of machines that does thing more quickly]. That is what has happened in... many areas of agriculture, to use your own example. This would be good, except we live in a capitalist society (which I support for the time being since people need to work). I also do believe that one day the vast majority of the population will live relaxing lives free from labor. My main worry is getting to that place. There could be a lot of pain and misery on a scale we have never seen. I think that many people would not be very interested in art created solely by computers, I know that I wouldn\\'t be. it may be interesting, but it would be missing something crucial > They\\'ve been saying this since the 30s. Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, instead we are working longer hours than ever.  Being \"on the clock\" and being productive are completely different things.  Case in point, I, like probably many of you, are at work right now.  I *could* be doing work, but there is so much bureaucracy and nonsense that gets in the way that it\\'s hardly worth doing more than the bare minimum.  Fortunately, I don\\'t work at a company where I need to pretend to work long hours (I do work sometimes after hours but that\\'s because something has to be done outside of business hours.)  In general, I\\'m in the office 40 hours a week in order to be available if someone needs me.  If I\\'m stuck waiting on emails, processes, and meetings to happen before I can do my work, then I\\'m on reddit.  What is a big problem is that the majority of office workers are goofing off, and getting paid decent amounts to do it.  The reason we have jobs is because there are people in management who want to make more money and become powerful, and they need staff to justify it.  So the more employees in their departments, the more powerful they are.  Contrast that with the unemployed and underemployed, some of which would be more qualified to work in an office than many, and it\\'s a strange, unstable system just waiting to collapse. Why? What about robots makes it invalid? I\\'d just like to point out that the extra working hours are a completely arbitrary thing and are not needed. The concept of a 8 hour workday has been ingrained for so long in our culture that even if you have nothing to do you are expected to be at work for 8 hours a day, in most jobs. This leads to either giving you nothing to do, or making you do stupid shit, or building more administrative bullshit to keep up with to waste everyone\\'s time. We are working longer hours, but we are working less than ever before. So take that \"longer hours\" thing with a grain of salt. It truly is meaningless for most people Hell no.   This entire \"sanctity of work\" thing is a con with far too much invested in it to allow it to just belly up over night. You\\'ve got decades, and the worst is yet to come. As soon as we replace good paid workers with robots, those former employees will get worse jobs, and the scale will slide further down.  Hire employee, pay them well, learn how to make their job easier, give them more responsibilities, go back two steps until it can no longer be done and you\\'ve got a nice job title PACKED with more responsibilities than a day can nearly handle.   That is when you bring someone new in for half the price. \"Previous guy couldn\\'t handle the work load,\" they\\'ll say as they look at you expectantly.  Because this is the first job that\\'s considered you for a job with benefits and full time, you chirp up and say \"No worries boss, I\\'m a hard worker!\".  That\\'s the spirit, Johnny. Now you\\'re working twice as hard as the last guy at his start, for half his eventual pay.  It\\'s not just automation, but also cost and time saving initiatives. That would be fine if it were passed on to the customer or used to pay higher wages, but generally it is just used to generate higher profits/put into a CEOs bank.  This is irrelevant because of comparative advantage.  For example, even if Warren Buffett is better than you at every possible job (which he isn\\'t), it still makes sense for him to run his company rather than doing whatever you do.  Similarly, even if machines are better at humans at everything, even at art and philosophy, it still makes sense for them to concentrate on their relative strengths and humans to concentrate on theirs. The Black Death is often cited as one of the many factors that birthed the Renaissance. Rigid social structures start breaking down when you indiscriminately kill off a third of Europe, and that breakdown opens up paths of self-advancement and social mobility for the survivors.  I think similar gains are possible with widespread birth control use though. Not going to bother responding to Godwin\\'s Law. Sorry. What I said is nothing like the holocaust. Reposting a comment I made elsewhere in this thread:  Here\\'s the problem.  CGP is not an economist.

If you want to see, in detail, what CGP got wrong, I\\'d recommend you [read it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey/comments/2dfh5v/humans_need_not_apply/cjp7pk8). I get the theory but it only seems relevant to people competing with people not machines. i don\\'t think i quite follow. as i see it the reason people are forced to work more for less pay is because companies are able to force people to work more for less pay. there\\'s an excess of labor essentially. so the question is what caused an excess of labor? either our population is too large or automation has killed off too many jobs. at the moment it\\'s probably a combination of both. but i don\\'t quite understand what you mean when you say society is forcing people to work longer hours for less pay.   if it\\'s true that we had \"busy work\" and that is what\\'s causing the up tick in hours, wouldn\\'t there be less unemployment? or at the very least wouldn\\'t there be a lot more waste? as in company\\'s pay would be mostly waste as most people aren\\'t being productive, since they\\'re just doing busy work. but all the indications for productivity suggests there isn\\'t so much busy work. people are producing more then ever before. >if it\\'s true that we had \"busy work\" and that is what\\'s causing the up tick in hours, wouldn\\'t there be less unemployment?  Considering how much less actual work there is to do, there is a lot less unemployment than there would be without busy work.  >or at the very least wouldn\\'t there be a lot more waste? as in company\\'s pay would be mostly waste as most people aren\\'t being productive, since they\\'re just doing busy work. but all the indications for productivity suggests there isn\\'t so much busy work.  Most people in white collar jobs will tell you that they\\'re only actively producing a small fraction of the day. This is part of why social media has become so prolific, a large portion of people are spending work time as leisure time because they can accomplish what used to be an 8-hour day of work in a small fraction of that time.  >people are producing more then ever before.  No, society is producing more than ever before, thanks to automation. People are continuing to log \"work hours\" at a higher rate than ever, but those hours are more weighted towards leisure and away from output than they\\'ve ever been before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEjdiE0AoCU  Emily Howell is a robotic composer.   http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/Emily-howell.htm but if I knew that it was a likelihood, it would cheapen any recorded music sure but, think of how many accidents there are everyday from human drivers. the research shows the driverless cars are far far safer then manned vehicles. Ah this is the absolute best argument against this view! Sadly I don\\'t think comparative advantage will save us here for a few reasons.   First of all companies often don\\'t make choices in accordance with comparative advantage. Vertical integration should be a terrible idea according to comparative advantage yet many companies like to do it.  Second of all, human productivity will be a rounding error compared to the sheer power of machines. Getting 0.0001% more efficiency might not be worth some of the headaches of hiring employees (who by the way will likely be feeling pretty unfulfilled and depressed being second class undervalued workers). I recommend you read Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut since his world is a bit like the one you propose but morale is a huge problem.  Third, efficiency is meaningless if you have more efficiency than you could possibly use. The earth has a finite amount of resources and a finite amount of consumers. If the machines you have can process all available resources and or make more than enough goods to meet demand and still have time when they are not needed than extra efficiency isn\\'t particularly helpful.   Last but not least, employees strike, they need benefits, there are safety regulations, they bother you to buy girlscout cookies. The people at the top have a lot more reasons to use machines than just economic ones. Even though they are creating more poverty by doing so, replacing sweatshop workers with robots will put a stop to a lot of smear campaigns.  Edit* Spelling > In the not too distant future that will no longer be true  Hard AI won\\'t exist in the not too distant future. Youre point is moot Way longer than the 30s, actually.  The Luddites were protesting against automated weaving looms in the early 19th century because they thought it would put them out of work.  You know what?  They were right.  They all lost their jobs.  The economy readjusted, and the automation gains contributed to increased standards of living for everyone, in the long run.  Automation has been happening for millennia.  Think of how many hunter-gatherers lost their jobs when we figured out you could grow food in the ground.  Think of all the laborer jobs that were lost when we realized you could have an oxen pull a wheeled cart.  Automation has led to increased income throughout history, and there\\'s no reason to think that trend will suddenly reverse itself. > Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut  Don\\'t particularly want to go through this entire post, but can I just remark on the fact that the only \"citations\" I ever hear for this view is works of popular media?  I\\'ve also had the movie Bladerunner cited as \"evidence\".  Kurt Vonnegut is a tremendous writer, but he\\'s not evidence.   > Yes it does.  What you have linked to is a description of Moores law, \"the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.\"  Researchers are finding out that this trend is [stopping](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=moore\\'s%20law%20end). Hard physical limitations, such as the speed of light, or a signal from one chip to another are showing that their is an asymptote to chip speed.  >However computers are statistically safer drivers than humans.

Got any sources?  >There may be a time when that is no longer true, but it\\'s not coming in the next few decades.   Aren\\'t we on the cusp of automated cars? Aren\\'t computers more accurate at diagnosis than a flesh-and-blood doctor? Haven\\'t anesthesiologists recently been engaging in protectionism in order to avoid being replaced by (more accurate) automation?  I get that there isn\\'t going to be a watershed moment, at least not around the corner, but don\\'t you think that in the coming years there\\'s going to be a dramatic shift in the labor market? Just because we have the tech, doesn\\'t mean we can use it productively.   We shouldn\\'t have to have IT as much as we do.  The world is different now from the 1930s. This counter argument is irrelevant. We are way more connected to each other as countries are too and wider also.  I don\\'t agree, the technology didn\\'t exist back then to be able to fully automate things like building cars. Now, we have extremely precise robotics and computer systems that are complex enough to adapt in real time. It\\'s easy to use your imagination when thinking about the potential long term effects of a new thing/behavior and be pretty accurate. So, I don\\'t think the fact that it didn\\'t happen 80 years ago is any indication about the likelihood of it happening now.  On the other hand, not all industries are really susceptible to automation. For example, the medical industry requires bedside manner which is the obvious thing preventing automation. Medical workers rely on their ability to get important information from patients who are vague, deceitful, or simply don\\'t know enough to concisely communicate their problems. On top of that, emergency medical workers work in some of the most unpredictable environments that exist. The physical dexterity in tight spaces coupled with navigating an unpredictable terrain is enough to make robot ambulances a monumentally difficult thing to achieve. It\\'s possible it would happen eventually but it will require not only better artificial intelligence than we are capable of making currently as well as a complete overhaul of the way we build houses to allow a robot to even access most patients in the first place.  Compare this to something like fast food or manufacturing. Flipping burgers or even cooking complex dishes can DEFINITELY be reduced to a repetitive process that a machine could accomplish.  I think people will experience more of a shift of desired expertise rather than a complete elimination of people from jobs in the near future. At least until technology improves further. Eventually, it WILL happen.  the same was true about books written by women not long ago.  they just took on pen names and published as men, then once everyone accepted their work they might decide to reveal their identity.  it would be easy to do the same with computer art today. I will try to go point by point:  Interesting point on the Moore\\'s law. You are right but we are already far along and perhaps quantum computing will bring us back up to speed. Before I sound like an idiot again, yes I know quantum computing won\\'t improve the devices of the average consumer, but it will make a lot of computers perform a lot better (theoretically).  I don\\'t really get your all computers and all humans point. Babies can\\'t drive either. All that matters is that the computers that we have driving us around know how to drive.  You are right on the music thing because people like the idea of celebrities but the fact that computers can do it still means they are intelligent and can simulate creativity.  Computers don\\'t publish original research because they don\\'t care about anything so we have to tell them what to do. Computers play an increasingly indispensable role in science and research of people I personally know is based almost entirely on computer simulations.  First of all, genetic algorithms can make better genetic algorithms, it is experimental and it is called meta-genetic programming. You are right though, I know very little about meta-genetic programming, only that there is work on it. Second of all, the quote of mine you called a bald faced lie is basically the definition of genetic algorithms. Better is subjective and by better I meant in terms of the fitness algorithm. If you include efficiency in that algorithm somehow then the genetic algorithm will improve in that respect.  The thing that is impressive isn\\'t that it is walking it is that it is walking simply by flexing the \"muscles\" shown. In computer games the walking is a simple animation.  I am not an idiot. I know computers work by preforming operations on binary data and the human brain sends impulses across neurons and they are very different. They are still both information storage and processing systems and they can often accomplish the same tasks. Also with computer systems we can simulate brains. A European team is currently working on simulating a mouse brain.  Wow that was a lot. I feel like I am having five different discussions with you. Sorry to get to this level.  No one dies... Those people find other things to do. It also isn\\'t like suddenly the Gestapo burst into their weaving facilities and burned them to the ground and replaced them with barbed wire covered machines.  Their businesses slowly went under, while more facilities that used machines took over. Eventually, a few remain for people who want hand woven stuff, but they are mostly gone. It\\'s like bookstores or video stores today.  Does it though? The only proof of concept was not able to pass Nevada driving test without a person intervening multiple times, even during a specifically designed route with perfect weather. It looks like driver assisted vehicles will be around for a while. Users and producers.   Producers will probably become more \\'open source\\' in their attitude. You\\'ll notice amongst the rich that those who are comfortable with losing wealth are the ones who made it themselves.  I would challenge the idea that we\\'ve \"naturally\" come to work more than ever due to an increase in actual work to do. Instead, we\\'ve become so culturally reliant on labor as the primary source of individual worth that we create work when there is none to do.  The assertion that the hours we work will continue to increase isn\\'t necessarily wrong, but I believe it is for different reasons than you suppose. not everyone can be a programmer.  You\\'re assuming that there are an infinite number of machines. In reality, machines, just like people, can only do one thing at a time. If it\\'s more advantageous for them to work on A than B, humans can still make money doing B.   Humans are incredibly cheap, self-reproducing, intelligent robots that are capable of doing most tasks that machines can do. They can survive on a couple of dollars of beans and rice a day, and live 10 to a hovel. It\\'s extremely unlikely that machines will ever be able to price them out of *all* labor.   Note: I\\'m not saying any of this is a pleasant outcome, nor that we should prefer it to alternatives. But comparative advantage really does work, and makes everyone better off than the alternative, all else being equal.  It\\'s not evidence just a book I thought you\\'d like.  Edit* I could give you actual sources if you want. > The most apparent example is that politicians are constantly talking about \"jobs\" as if they\\'re important, when all that really matters is quality of life.  Nail on the head, brother, nail on the head.  That depends on if [the life of your dreams has died.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgFtQPgHyek) That argument is tenuous at best.  I see it used every single time someone brings this up, but automation is now reaching some areas that people considered secure, such as the service industry.    There has always been some type of work that required a lot of labor, whether it be manufacturing, construction, data entry, electronics or the service industry.  The manual labor requirements aren\\'t shrinking too fast, but they are shrinking.  The localized labor is the part that keeps towns/cities functional.  When the big labor users automate it has big impacts.    Chili\\'s and others are testing automated tablets for you to handle everything yourself, so you can get rid of waiters and just downgrade to bussers, which will be paid less and get less tips because they aren\\'t providing as much service.  Stores had mixed success with self checkout, but they will continue to improve them until they are the norm.  In 5-10 years you will simply walk your cart up to a register and it will read the RFID chips and have you swipe your card and go.    Yes, people work longer hours because companies can push their employees harder, companies LIKE you to be afraid to lose your job.  Fear that a single illness will put you in the poor house is great for labor management.  Keynes isn\\'t completely wrong, there is a lot of inefficiency in the system on purpose... people make companies that do similar things to other companies, so diversification of things like clothing and cars help keep labor busy, for now.   \"It hasn\\'t happened yet\" is not a solid argument.  Automation is happening faster, and we also added in a global work force.  3D printing, cheaper robotics and more complex automation will have a major impact in the next 20 years because the government will have to solve the growing underemployment problem one way or another, and the moment large corporations don\\'t have the ability to take advantage of their employees they will quickly reduce their need for them further. This is *almost* a good reply, but do you really not understand the difference between labor force participation and unemployment? >Will the solution of the past (just do something else) keep working or not?  It doesn\\'t seem like it, because what\\'s left? When the only jobs left are building/programming/maintaining/improving the computers, that doesn\\'t seem like a system that provides billions of jobs.  >>Technology improves at an exponential rate  >No it doesn\\'t  Yes it [does](http://trace.wisc.edu/tech-overview/indexe9e5.html?attachment_id=256).   >No they wont. and no they arnt. Computers arnt any smarter than they were 40 years ago. Hell you computers dont even have a measure of smartness.  You\\'re right. \"Smartness\" isn\\'t a rigorous term at all. However computers are statistically safer drivers than humans. They have become better at answering natural speech questions. Computers are essentially unbeatable at chess. Computers can make music. Even in the loose colloquial definition computers really have become smarter. Perhaps it is impossible to measure all around \"smartness\" (even IQ doesn\\'t take everything into account) but by any metric computers are improving fast.  With genetic programming computer programs can evolve like organisms and make better versions of themselves. They can even make programs that we can\\'t. [Here](http://vimeo.com/79098420) you can see computers using it to teach simulated robots to walk. Could you imagine programming walking algorithms like that manually? It would take an eternity.  Perhaps I am being too definite saying that one day it WILL happen, but why can\\'t it? Our brain isn\\'t too much different from a computer. They are already working on making simulated brains in computers in fact. Maybe it is hard to hear but humans aren\\'t so special that we can never be beaten. Machines can already make classical music as good as any composer. How long until this true of any genre? [here\\'s a start](http://io9.com/5973551/this-classical-music-was-created-by-a-supercomputer-in-less-than-a-second) Things where machines are relatively less better at doing them. Really, this is the reason that international trade exists even when one country is simply better than others at practically everything.   If I can make $20 thing A for $10, and $20 thing B for $15, my best use of resources is to make A, 100% of the time, even if people need B, too.   Someone else that can make $22 B\\'s for $17  (i.e. they are less efficient than I am) can still make a living because I can make an extra $5 making extra A\\'s even if I have to spend $2 more for B\\'s. Even if I undercut them by selling my B\\'s for $21, it is still a win for me to make A\\'s instead of B\\'s.  Why?  When it was was farmer using one plow and ox, doing the work of dozens of people, the same thing happened.  Those others went and built civilization. It may be different, but that\\'s not the reason.  Automation still needs setting-up and maintenance, you\\'re not taking the human completely out of the equation. You cite computers, yet they are a form of automation as well.  These events shift things around. The questions are where will we end up and what\\'s on the way... Will the solution of the past (just do something else) keep working or not? That\\'s only significant when Warren Buffets are scarce. You\\'d still have a job even if Warren Buffet was better in every way, only if there is only a small number of Warren Buffets.  If instead Warren Buffet can be cranked off an assembly line for $10000, and cost $300 of electricity to run a month thereafter, where would your comparative advantage be? So we will have two classes, inventive folks (techs, engineers, artists, etc) and... I cant think of what the less intelligent people will be left with.   I totally agree with you about how capitalism can do that. I also totally support capitalism as an economic system in this day in age. I just think we will reach a point where people are no longer able to find jobs at all and even though less labor is needed people won\\'t have money because they are unemployable. I think you\\'re underestimating automation. It\\'s not just manufacturing. It\\'s transportation, retail, customer service... Even creative industries. Programs can already make compelling, original music.  The point is that it doesn\\'t matter how many computers there are, because each computer can only build one song, or something very similar to it, and that song was painstakingly programmed in. We are at the stage where getting a computer to compose a song is amazing. We are very far from the stage we can replace musicians with machines that are capable of legitimate creativity. Is work hours really all OP is worried about?    I feel like this argument is akin to telling me rocks are diet foods by focusing in on how little calories they have.    How will wealth be effected for the classes?  What types of jobs will we be left with to perform for 40 hours a week?  Will we share in the wealth produced?  Will tasks become more menial?    Having the same amount of hours to work seems threatening in and of itself.   > When Americans are better at everything than Hondurans, what are Hondurans going to make?  You could argue that America has an absolute advantage over just about everything with many poorer countries in the world, but we still trade with them.  I doubt I\\'ll be able to explain comparative advantage better than [this Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage), so I\\'d recommend you just head over there. There are a lot of other jobs that will be affected as well. Car insurance agents and body shop repair, and a lot of automotive repair will also see need for their services greatly reduced. Delivery truck drivers and postal workers won\\'t be far behind. And even if automation will somehow make fewer jobs there is probably no good reason to be scared of it. Not working and getting money is not that bad. We can still all become artists or just do what we want to do all day like growing our own food, reading and raising kids. The taxes will just have to be high enough for all to get a reasonable income. And since progress has only come with higher productivity so far, we will probably see fewer people earning much more - paying more in tax. But even taking all that into consideration we still have not seen this technology that makes us jobless and poor effect in real life. Only uneducated people have suffered the people not able to adjust, learn or move to better jobs. So why do we expect this effect now? Trade barriers to protect jobs such as mining and steelwork has not improved the economy it just made sure that some people could continue doing their old job and not finding a new job. Even Detroit is adjusting and becoming a rich city again, just smaller. I think you\\'re overestimating automation. There is not a computer in the world that you can go up to and ask to write you a prog metal opera, or rap, or jazz, or anything you name. There are many special-purpose things that are incredibly useful and will have a tremendous impact on the workforce, but there is no general purpose AI out there. We have made essentially no progress on the Hollywood style strong AI. Right now, a computer cannot be truly creative. You can teach a computer the rules of how to put something together, and give it a method to determine the quality of an example, but you can\\'t generalize that. If I want a computer-generated prog metal opera then I\\'m gonna have to sit down and write everything about how to generate such a thing, figure out how to programatically appraise a given example, and essentially define a very powerful but very dumb machine. It would produce a prog metal opera. It could not produce a rap. For that, you\\'d have to start from scratch. Not yet. With AI assistance, sure.  [it\\'s not that hard](http://io9.com/5973551/this-classical-music-was-created-by-a-supercomputer-in-less-than-a-second)  there\\'ll be as many computers as there are musicians today. How many programmers there will be is probably a fair number less.  No I know it seems absurd of me.   I know comparative advantage is widely accepted. I just think things can change.  In the scenario of machines being better at everything I don\\'t see what people have to trade.  Usual comparative advantage looks at people looking for return on their time and resources. Machines aren\\'t like that.  We haven\\'t gone back to weaving cloth because machines are better at making cars.  Imagine an AI nation with robots and computers all more powerful than humans in every way. Every action more efficient than what exactly would another nation offer? > Automation still needs setting-up and maintenance, you\\'re not taking the human completely out of the equation.   Until AIs can do this themselves... ?   It\\'s not like the development would just exclude engineers, as soon as you manage to replace every other job. It was one of multiple factors that caused the great depression. A lot of people simply died from increased suicide rates or resulting violence.  Because computers, machine learning, massive data sets, and robotics haven\\'t changed anything?  CGPGrey isn\\'t an economist, and his video doesn\\'t cite any.  His entire point is completely naive from an economics standpoint.  It\\'s called comparative advantage - even if machines have an absolute advantage over humans in everything, they can still gain via trade. Agriculture was around 90% of the workforce a couple hundred years ago, and today it\\'s less than 2%.  That\\'s a lot of workers who were displaced by things like the tractor.  Shouldn\\'t we have 88% unemployment? CGP Grey would like to have a word with you. Or in other words, here is why automation is to be feared. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU fucking. no kidding. just ask /r/talesfromtechsupport  Actually, that\\'s a good explanation of how (eventually) automation is going to run people out of jobs. Automation isn\\'t multiplying the amount of work people can do, the way the industrial and digital revolutions did. It\\'s REMOVING human slowness and incompetence from the equation.  Throughout human history there has been at least one skill that a human had and a machine did not. In the not too distant future that will no longer be true. Your line of thinking about historical patterns is analogous to citizens of a planet drifting into its star saying \"oh it has been getting warmer for thousands of years and nothing bad has come of it, we have always just adjusted, why should it be any different if we hit the star?\"  [My favourite composition from Emily Howell, a music-generating algorithm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEjdiE0AoCU) But you might not be able to distinguish it. They could pretend it\\'s human-made. Speed.  The speed with which these technological jumps is increasing similar to Moore\\'s Law.   The only thing we have to remove from our culture is the \"Sanctity of Work\" malarkey we\\'ve got going right now, and the answers will become apparent. Sure it is still a multiplier.  The ratios change.  Unless you take it to where technology becomes a new form of life, which is very different from automation. I see no reason why it can\\'t. Technology improves at an exponential rate. We are already able to simulate neural networks. Computers get smarter and smarter and one day computers will make better computers. Even now some computers can program themselves better than we can program them. And when it happens is irrelevant. One day it will happen, in 50 years or 100 years the problem is coming. You are suggesting that out of every 100 people, at least 20 have jobs that consist of manually driving a vehicle. Not that they drive one in order to do their job, but that their job *is* driving.  I can think of bus drivers, taxi drivers, and truck drivers. I don\\'t think they comprise 20% of the workforce. Note that \"delivery truck driver\" or \"postal worker\" don\\'t count, because they still need to perform additional tasks at each destination. yes but the problem was that that automation effected 1 smallish section of the economy. we can be generous and say that the weaving industry was 10-20% of the workforce, but that pales in comparison to the job loss automation is set to clean up when driverless cars hit the market. not to mention that production robots are becoming much smarter so virtually all manufacturing can be automated. when the weavers lost their job they were just able to switch to other menial task work. but automation is set to completely erase all menial work jobs unless you\\'re willing to work for slave labour wages. There\\'s a floor to how low a human can sell labor for.  If automation costs in below that floor, it is impossible for human labor to compete; you\\'d starve to death trying.    If we assume there is no task that in principle can\\'t be automated and we assume there is no necessary reason the costs of such automation can\\'t fall below the floor of human labor, then we know of no reason as to why in some possible future humans aren\\'t unemployable. > No they wont. and no they arnt. Computers arnt any smarter than they were 40 years ago. Hell you computers dont even have a measure of smartness.  You\\'re actually fundamentally wrong on this point.   There are basically 3 major ways of identifying intelligence in psychology: the 3-stratum model; multiple intelligences model; and the triarchic theory of intelligence. The stratum model is the one that most clearly aligns to the biological functioning of our brain and is largely gaining the most traction. The other two are useful as abstractions but do not seem to match up to how our brain actually works.   The 3-stratum model says that intelligence is really an emergent property that we see by looking at narrow specific abilities, which in turn layered up to broad abilities, and that all that together the whole of these broad abilities is our IQ.   In the AI field, specific narrow abilities have definitively increased. As just one example, chess computers can now regularly beat the world champion whereas 40 years ago they couldn\\'t beat a decent club player. Since the stratum model says intelligence is an umbrella that covers these layers, and the lowest layer has increased, under this model computers are unarguably more intelligent than they were 40 years ago.   The other two models follow similar analysis, so I won\\'t go into them here. But basically, as far as cognitive psychology goes -- computers are doing better in measures of intelligence.   Now you might say that passing electrons around in a brute force algorithm isn\\'t the same as really playing chess so that isn\\'t intelligence. But the reality is that it is the same. That is the point of the Turing test. While the underpinning computations are vastly different, the functional result is indistinguishable from an external perspective.   We don\\'t pretend that computers are intelligent because they have a really big biological brain. We understand they are silicone and copper and plastic and metal and function at a low level much differently than humans do. But the resulting output is indistinguishable from highly intelligent human action. And that is how we measure intelligence.   Cars aren\\'t slower than humans because they don\\'t have legs to run on. They are still faster than humans around a track. Likewise, computers are smarter, much smarter, than they were 40 years ago, and they are on pace to put us to shame in numerous areas very, very soon (and in many areas they are doing so already).   The computer program Eugene nearly passed a formal Turing test this year for human language interaction. He convinced 10 of 30 expert judges that he was a human being. It won\\'t be too long before that number climbs to 30 of 30. Computers aren\\'t more intelligent than us generally, yet. But as each of their narrow specialties becomes better and better, and as networking computers together becomes easier and faster, it will not be long before a computer, or network of computers, is superior to us at every human task.   I\\'m not saying next week. But if the advances of the last few years continue to show as much promise as they have, the next few decades will be game changing.   Death. i dunno, if you adjust for inflation people are producing more for less money. wages have stagnated while productivity has increased steadily. that might indicate that automation is forcing people to work longer hours for less pay, eventually it will get to the point where you either accept slave labour wages or your job is automated. > Programs can already make compelling, original music.  Not without programmers. Not sure, but I think that\\'s what he was trying to point out.  > Because computers, machine learning, massive data sets, and robotics haven\\'t changed anything?  He\\'s not saying \\'nothing has changed\\'. He\\'s saying the need for human workers has not changed. Even with the advent of modern computing and robotics, we\\'re working more than ever. Every time a new advance comes along, it creates, essentially, a new sector for people to work in.   There may be a time when that is no longer true, but it\\'s not coming in the next few decades.  Disagree. Technological progress isn\\'t linear. Artificial intelligence and the hardware and software that underpins it are becoming more advanced *at an increasing rate*.   >They\\'ve been saying this since the 30s.  It wasn\\'t a realistic fear in the 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. It is now. Ok.  So... can you tell me when this is going to start happening? Unemployment in America has been steadily declining for about 4 years running now. Even the high unemployment of 2009-10 had nothing to do with automation. We\\'ve had the Internet widespread for 15 years or so by now.  Any day now I guess? So for me to agree with you, I have to discount the entire field of economics because economists are sometimes wrong (surely it\\'s the only field where practitioners are occasionally wrong), and have a super negative view of humans.  And then, IDK, there might be a genocide.  I\\'ve always wondered what the intermediary steps are between automating jobs and genocide.  Seems like it\\'d make for a decent sci-fi movie. These massive economic shifts rarely happen overnight.  Its not like once the automatic weaving machine came into being you had 100% unemployment of weavers.  The weaving needs still existed while machines were being produced, tuned, and improved upon over many years.  Workers would see the writing on the wall as hiring stopped for new weavers, but existing weavers had jobs for years to come.  Many weavers likely aged out and retired shrinking the weaver workforce, until the very end where a small percentage of the original weavers are fired.    Even then, as weavers, there are job skills they are knowledgeable of that couldn\\'t be machine replaced at the time.   These weavers likely got jobs maintaining stock or filling orders, or perhaps quality assurance of machine produced goods. > The thing that is impressive isn\\'t that it is walking it is that it is walking simply by flexing the \"muscles\" shown. In computer games the walking is a simple animation.  How do you think those animations were made? The animator essentially uses the same object, some model with a skeleton connected by movable joints and manipulated by muscles. The animator too is only flexing muscles to make the model move...  The quality in difference is that the animator has seen and can see and compare at any point real life footage of similar structures walking. What the animator arrives at, the \"simple animation\", is no different than what the algorithm can produce. The impressive part is that the algorithm arrives at the same solution without prior knowledge... because there isn\\'t a job that automation can\\'t replace. there aren\\'t other jobs to do, because automation can replace literally EVERY job. People can\\'t go and do something else, because everything can be done by machines, cheaper, faster, and better.  I think that that guy is missing Greys point completely. Of course humans will adapt to the situation, he was clearly just starting the conversation for the average viewer. The video seems to heavily hint of his favour of a basic income, but he doesn\\'t outright say it because he wants thr viewer to ckme to that conclusion on their own It won\\'t change if we keep inventing new jobs like we did in the past. But at one point that will be pretty hard to do when most manual labor goes into robot hands. Look what happened to agriculture. Now imagine this happens to basically all manual labor. Pretty horrifying in my opinion.  Not to mention, automation will also find its place in non-manual labor too. i don\\'t want to die twice.. :/ Pretty much, for every job you apply for, there will already be a Warren Buffet doing it far better than you ever could, for the cost of just your electricity bill. For sure, per capita work hours is only one factor of many, and by itself not the scariest/most interesting. I was merely showing that human labour is going down (slightly, in the US over the past 40 years), contrarily to the statement in the post I was replying to.',\n 'This is a great answer, and I\\'d add that we have limited resources (time, energy money) to support causes we believe in while still treating ourselves as well as possible in life.

It\\'s all about where you draw the line on what is important enough/efficient enough to change that it\\'s worth taking action. This is how I feel about it. Every dollar someone spends crusading about the plight of cows is a dollar that could be feeding starving children in India.

Y\\'know, deal with the immediate problems like malnutrition or genocide before we worry about the inhumane suffering of cows. >  I think people quickly reach a point of ethical fatigue where they simply can\\'t care anymore. A completely ethical lifestyle is probably not possible without completely rejecting the modern world.  It seems as though we can all only choose and work towards one small change, and hope that we can collectively make a difference over the course of generations. Yeah, I think there\\'s just a limited number of things that people are capable of caring about at one time, and issues that are of personal relevance are always going to carry more weight.  So while someone might take Option 1 on a personally significant issue that has a lot of meaning to them, the limitations of the human mind force them to take Option 3 on a whole lot of other issues.  So somebody who takes Option 3 on a particular issue may not be making a true choice to *ignore* that issue.  They\\'re just prioritizing their mental resources.  Without prioritizing those resources, there\\'s a risk of \"compassion fatigue,\" which you see frequently among people in empathy-intensive occupations (especially medicine, education, and other fields where issues outside the individual\\'s control tend to produce strong feelings of frustration and futility).  I do care about the welfare of food animals, and I do think that there are ways to produce meat in ways that are at least more humane if not more \"ethical.\"  I support these efforts when they\\'re available.  But I also think that the welfare of food animals is part of a much larger constellation of interrelated \"food production issues\" that involve everything from environmental impacts to worker safety to the corporatization of agriculture to government subsidies, and that without some major changes to those other \"food production issues\" then there probably won\\'t be significant improvement in animal welfare.  So to that end, it\\'s good that people have different Option 1 priorities to attack the problems from multiple sides. You sir, are one articulate dude.

The first one is yours, that prison is there to separate and resctrict freedom for the inmate. This lead to mexican style prison(not official name), in witch they have city inside the prison with people living there lives normally complete with elections, buying better houses and even a judicial system and a prison inside the prison!  Then you have the old testament style prison (idem), in witch the goal of the prison is though to be to punish people, the prisons in the USA (please correct me if I am wrong, I would love to be wrong about this :). In it you have story of people evading from prison to get basic healthcare done (like going to the dentist after three week of pain!).  And finally you have the Scandinavian style prison where the goal of the prison is seen as \"reeducating\" the inmate until they are again deemed \"fit to the society\". In it you have story like mass murderer complaining of \"only\" having a PS2 instead of a PS3 to play with.  Personally I am a fan of the 3rd type but I\\'ll admit that each type has its flaw and each correspond of a different worldview  Now back to the point, you have to recognise that your point make sense under old testament style prison, but not under Mexican prisons and less under the Scandinavian one (if you\\'re gonna spend money on getting someone to be productive again you want him/her to live linger so you get more for your work but it start being an economical decision)',\n 'I edited what I said.

Not exactly.  The original post is fixated on fiscal policy and thinks FDR just had bad fiscal policy, I am making the case that OP is focusing on the wrong sort of policy in analyzing the depression, and that the reason stated for the end of the depression isn\\'t really accurate.  In the broadest sense it agrees with OP\\'s headline view, but it differs importantly on the reasoning.  Edit re: edit, are you referring to [this paper?](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~cromer/What%20Ended%20the%20Great%20Depression.pdf) Ferguson says that the Bank of England action caused a wave of devaluations by other countries, which is true sorta* - but doesn\\'t tell us that the devaluations caused the depression to get worse.  Indeed, Ferguson is saying that the devaluations were \"the essential first step towards recovery in the Depression.\"  *It took a few years.  The French took forever and had a much worse employment picture than most other countries in that timeframe - the US took til March 1933. Who says that?  I\\'m not trying to be glib, but I need a little more to that to sink my teeth into.  Can you point to an article or paper which makes that case?  For my case on the mechanism I\\'d point you to [*The Gold Standard, Deflation, and Financial Crisis in the Great Depression: An International Comparison*](http://www.nber.org/chapters/c11482.pdf) by Bernanke and James.  Also almost anything by Barry Eichengreen, who is one of the premier scholars on this. Who says this? Harvard professor Niall Ferguson says it in a [Financial Times opinion article](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cdc80aa0-6638-11e2-b967-00144feab49a.html#axzz3NvRFL3kf). He also gives credit to Eichengreen though. I\\'m going to search up Eichengreen now. I don\\'t think we really disagree here.  And I agree the Romer paper is pretty persuasive.  The New Deal was probably a net negative I agree - though some aspects outside of the gold stuff was good, such as FDIC. I think OP is misreading Ferguson - literally. Ferguson is making the point that I am making, and OP is apparently confusing \"devaluation\" with \"economic harm.\" This agrees with OP, it doesn\\'t try to change OPs view.  EDIT: I should say that Roosevelt\\'s good policies were limited, so very little of what FDR did was helpful.  Leaving the gold standard and bank holidays were good ideas. But it wasn\\'t the New Deal (which was found to be a net bad by [Cole and Ohanian](http://hlcole.bol.ucla.edu/NewDealucla.pdf)).  Also *gold influxes* were the reason for growth before the beginning of the second world war, which is what [Christy Romer found](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~cromer/What%20Ended%20the%20Great%20Depression.pdf).  All in all, FDR had little to do with the economic recovery,  besides maybe one good policy choice.  EDIT 2: Sources and spelling corrections. I\\'m not saying you\\'re wrong or that Ferguson is wrong but you should know that:  a) Ferguson is a professor of history, not economics, and his statements about economics are viewed controversially at best by economists (I remember this article you linked receiving a lot of backlash).  b) A large majority of economists believe the opposite of what Ferguson said; they believe that the gold standard was a harmful monetary policy [based more or less on this sort of thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Gold_standard).  So, again, not saying you\\'re necessarily wrong (though *I* think you probably are), but this isn\\'t really the best way to support your view and you should probably at least take into account the fact that most economists disagree. Some people say though, that it was the UK getting off the Gold Standard in 1931 that really made the depression bad.',\n ' You can\\'t go on it\\'s status symbolism alone. A \"luxurious\" item needs to be comfortable as well. If that\\'s all it takes to be a premium product,[this couch](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/sofa4.jpg) must be fit for a king. And I\\'m of the same opinion as OP - a leather seat is about as comfortable as a plastic wrapped couch.  With no sarcasm, I am not seeing what being easy to clean has to do with being a luxury product. In every other product category I can think of the luxury versions of the product are, if anything, generally harder to clean, having sacrificed the cleanability for some other feature. leather seats ought to be considered a feature suitable for a workhouse truck, not a luxury vehicle. Not really. Many luxurious items aren\\'t particularly comfortable. For instance, high heels are more of a \"luxury\" than tennis shoes but one is considered fit for high-fashion and luxury whereas the other is not. It will only help resale if it\\'s very well maintained.  Otherwise it will hurt the resale value. If we\\'re talking about what is more luxurious rather than what is most practical, then I\\'d say leather hands down. It\\'s a status symbol. You can question why it\\'s a status symbol but questioning it doesn\\'t change the fact that society views it that way. And I think that\\'s perfectly fine. Some people want practicality over luxury. Others want luxury over practicality (although going with leather isn\\'t really *that much* less practical). One benefit is that leather will probably help your resale value more than cloth will, but other than that, cloth is perfectly fine for a car. I can tell this plebe has never sat on a solid-gold shitter. This is exactly it. Leather seats are seen as luxurious, but are really just a status symbol.  I give approximately zero shits about status symbols. Even if I had a billion dollars, I\\'d never buy a $5,000 watch when I can look at my phone to check the time. And a status symbol that is actually LESS practical than the \"lesser\" (as far as status is concerned) option?  Fuck that noise.  I\\'ll be a peasant. This +1. Also worth using leather if you have small kids (again, because it is much easier to clean).',\n 'They disagreed with the title, but the title is bad and doesn\\'t accurately reflect OP\\'s position.  > I do disagree with Gade a little bit. I don\\'t think it would kill everybody, but the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes. I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much.  So OP had already qualified that his views are different from what he quoted, and the argument that humans aren\\'t going to die out is not against his view, even though the title says that is exactly his view. Um, yeah he did. \"Humans are going to die out\": he directly opposed that idea. It\\'s in his OP You phrased it better than I did, but you didn\\'t actually disagree with me.

We will be in a post-industrial society to rebuild society not with capitalism as its base structure but maybe true communism through the Internet (~~or other similar innovation, maybe Block Chain system for decentralized ~~ownership~~ ~~there wouldn\\'t be ownership at all~~ ).   In this society there would be a no sense of ownership. It\\'ll be similar to the people on Mars from the book, The Stranger in  a Strange Land. There would be no \"I\" in our knowledge.

I believe that small-medium improvements over large scales, such as an entire market, are better than large improvements at tiny scales.  Vegetarians aren't really relevant to OP's point, though.  Changing the behaviour of vegetarians will do nothing to improve the treatment of animals.  The goal is to change the behaviour of meat eaters by steering them towards more humane farming methods.   How does one go from a position of Utilitarianism to one that advocates the farming and eating of animals for pleasure? That simply must be a net loss.\",\n 'This is a very good point. I guess I\\'ve been assuming that there\\'s no way to tell that the organism inside the egg is a chicken until it hatches, and that the chicken inside doesn\\'t really exist until it has hatched. In that case, the egg becomes a chicken egg at the same time that the chicken begins to exist. And yet, \"the egg\" still existed before the chicken.  Then you can argue at what point the organism inside the egg becomes a chicken.  You\\'ve changed my view from \"It\\'s clear once you make a semantic choice\" to \"what a remarkably pointless question!\" :P  EDIT: Also, why did we make the assumption that we have to compare \"chicken egg\" to \"chicken\"? The usual framing of the question just says \"egg\" and \"chicken.\"  ∆  Well if a chicken egg is an \\'egg that bears a chicken,\\' that it\\'s being defined by having the property of bearing a \\'chicken.\\' So the chicken would have to exist first in order for the egg to be a \\'chicken egg\\' because if it were an egg that didn\\'t bear a chicken it would just be an egg.  Haha. As I was writing I thought the same thing, it is kind of pointless',\n 'The commercial was a miss for you. I\\'m sorry. Marketers don\\'t have the ability to only show you the commercials you like the most, yet. Just because you have a negative view of the commercial doesn\\'t mean that a majority of people (or just the target audience) has a negative reaction. What if, and bear with me here, pulling the commercial is a bad move because your reaction was atypical?  I never felt that the voice in that commercial was angry. It struck me as the kind of voice used while exercising or playing sports more than anger. We all decode things differently, but I honestly don\\'t get where anger reading came from there.  People who react to aggressive commercials with stress have a serious problem, because if they are being seriously stressed by commercials then they would be seriously stressed by daily interactions with people on the street. We shouldn\\'t be coddling those people, we should be actively helping them to manage the cause of those problems. Society as a whole cannot be expected to manage that problem for them, as such expectations are unhealthy. > So vegetarians are offended that other people eat meat or that some people sell meat? Even if they are offended, why does them being offended outweigh everything else?

True, but people have emotional reactions to what they see and hear even if it\\'s merely on TV, in a movie, or in a book they\\'ve read. Some people may react to loud, aggressive commercials with some amount of stress. And for what gain?  > Are you sure that potential customers are building negative associations? I mean, could it be that the average person *identifies* with the voice?  Well, I suppose I would have been a potential customer, yet Arby\\'s commercials have dissuaded me.

As an omnivore, I was dissuaded.  > What if the average person views the voice as \"passionate\" instead of \"threatening\"?  Maybe, but to me, angry shouting is not \"passionate,\" or at least not the positive kind. I can\\'t speak for how the average person interprets it.  > Moreover even those commercials that are hard to watch can be successful commercials.

It\\'s an inexpensive electrical device, you can\\'t just assume corruption because it fails.  Should it be looked at with more scrutiny?  Absolutely, but its comepletely contrary to our current justice system.  Saying \"Oh it malfunctioned because the battery ran out.  Must be the cop\\'s fault!  He definitely shot that guy on purpose!\"  That\\'s making a huge fucking leap.    Imagine a cop with 20 years on the force, clean records and zero complaints.  He gets in a shooting and ends up killing a suspect.  Goes in to turn his video footage, and the camera didn\\'t record properly.  Are you seriously going to sceam \"corruption!\" and hang the guy from the highest tree, unless he *proves* to you that he\\'s innocent?  Sounds like a witch hunt. The issue is that any officer wearing a camera can easily shut it down or otherwise cause malfunction (oops, I tripped and accidentally mashed my camera against the floor. Guess you were resisting arrest and I have to shoot you now!) whenever something inconvenient happens.  So I think his system makes perfect sense - assuming the cop is acting properly, he should always have the camera on. The only cops that benefit from body camera malfunctions are the corrupt and abusive ones.  Thus, we should assume that camera malfunction means possible abuse or corruption. This creates incentives where the good cops wear reliable cameras and keep spares on hand in case of malfunction, whilst the abusive cops are much more easily identified by repeated camera blank spots and repeated incidents of tampering with their cameras.  Finally, you\\'re right that there are plenty of situations where police should not be expected to wear body cameras. That is when you take them off. I do not see how this is relevant to the idea that at all other times, police on duty should wear them. >Are you seriously going to sceam \"corruption!\" and hang the guy from the highest tree, unless he proves to you that he\\'s innocent?  On Reddit? That\\'s absolutely what will be screamed.   >Sounds like a witch hunt.  Again, on Reddit, this is what the users do best.  When going up against an officer it\\'s pretty much guilty until proven innocent. Everyone is inclined to believe the word of an officer against an alleged criminal.   For the situations in which officers should not be wearing cameras:  Undercover: If it\\'s about cover being blown by a visible camera, would a microphone not suffice? And for situations in which wearing any recording instrument could jeopardize the officer\\'s life, like entering a drug fortress, we can assume the officer wouldn\\'t be using any brutality, either.  Courtroom: This is not a place where many conflicts between officers and citizens take place. And if they do, it\\'s a courtroom, full of witnesses to testify brutality.  Confidential informants: Why not record? It\\'s the police department that\\'s organizing the meeting. They already know about the informant. If anything a camera/microphone would prevent an officer from twisting the informant\\'s statements. The department wouldn\\'t be relying on memory.

If you go to /r/pcmasterrace do you shout to random people in gamestop about accepting the glory of gaben and leaving their peasant status behind?   Of course you don\\'t.

I never realized it was \"based\" in europe.   /r/sexyabortions (NSFL) comes to mind I think his argument is that people who browse it to a certain extent become worse people. You have to internalize the attitude of the board and the argument style of the commenters.  Same way any other sub is allowed to exist. You have two choices here. Either the bigots be allowed to have their community and discuss whatever they want in their own little corner of reddit, or reddit is allowed to close subs at will for being full of bigots. In societies with freedom of speech, the second option is generally considered to be *more* harmful overall than the first, because it is open to abuse. Abuse affects everybody in a negative way. Bigots having a corner to discuss their bigotry does not. That is an incredibly optimistic perspective. OP might say /r/4chan  To be fair /r/spacedicks is far from the worst sub on reddit. m00t turned off captcha, \"[trigger warning]\" flies above every post, and for like a month m00t had the audio of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPM6LKIaopk) **(NSFW)** playing every time you visited /pol/ There are some that are blatantly bad that other people have already pointed out, but a lot of defaults are kind of cesspools.

I find the additional perspectives that no one in their right mind would say aloud really interesting/funny because you would never actually say it, considering the stances society takes on certain issues. There\\'s far worse subreddits that I don\\'t think need to be posted NSFW/NSFL Yeah, they have a whole bunch of them too: http://www.reddit.com/r/GreatApes/comments/29zzoy/introducing_the_chimpire_a_network_of_nigger/ Imagine 4chan like an orchard of [apple] trees (hereby referred to as the [4]chard)while I tell you a story:   Long ago, when the [4]chard was but a few trees, a powerful poison was used to exterminate a pest that seemed particular to a couple of the trees. It was used most importantly(to the story) on the oldest, most central tree. The first tree. The tree that provided the seeds which eventually became the entire rest of the [4]chard.  This tree, and those similarly doused with pesticide, began to produce rotten [apple]s each harvest. It began with only a small number of [apple]s per harvest, and the rot seemed to be exclusive to those trees. In a short time however, it was evident that not only had the poison began to spread via the old trees\\' central root systems to the rest of the ever-expanding [4]chard, but that the pesticide was ultimately ineffective at eradicating it\\'s intended target. Ironically the pest would prove to be *so* persistent that it eventually developed a taste for the fruit of the poisoned trees in particular. So while ever-present throughout the rest of the [4]chard, the insignificant pest that was deemed capitally offensive to the young garden in it\\'s infancy eventually took up primary residence in the very trees that drastic measures had been taken to protect.   Over time, while the [4]chard continued to grow in the number of trees and overall quantity of [apple]s produced, each harvest produced more and more rotten fruit and less and less quality, refreshingly unique [apple]s. A symptom of the original poisoning invading the root system of the entire [4]chard, it wasn\\'t long before trees throughout, even those planted years later, would begin to exhibit signs of the same ills.   Today the [4]chard has massively increased in the number of trees on the plot, but the the overall quality of the fruit has experienced a noticeable and rapid decline over the years, with the discovery of truly fantastic and deserving [apple]s becoming more infrequent overall. The trees that were originally exposed to the toxicity are mere husks, crawling with parasites and very rarely producing fruit worth eating. They can\\'t be cut down now for the same reason they were praised and admired long ago. They\\'re integral to the root system of the entire [4]chard, and representative of the great and original idea that was the foundation for the [4]chard itself.    If you\\'ve the time and patience to sort through all of the semi-fermented garbage hanging about and don\\'t mind trying to ignore all of the annoying insects who\\'ve invaded the place, a brilliantly creative or otherwise distinguished specimen of an [apple] can still be gleaned from this hopeful collective that once seemed to have limitless potential.

At least, I think that\\'s what you mean by \"the 99% was people realising they do not matter.\" You mean the feeling of being powerless as an individual, right? Probably mixed with some un-earned entitlement? Not the knowledge of being less powerful due to the inequality that exists in the US Democratic/Capitalist government/economic system and the conclusion that such a system is unjust? Why would you think that those people *only then* became aware of or discontent with their place in life?  It sounds like what you\\'re describing is that moment people have somewhere between the age of 13 and 19 (or multiple times) about their own insignificance or powerlessness in the grand scheme of things. As if 15,000 protestors all went through teenage angst at the same time and decided to make a movement about it.   Did you read anything at all about the movement? > It is based on a fallacy that money = well being. It hasn\\'t for the majority of time, why make a big deal about it now?  [That\\'s really not true](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/yes-money-does-buy-happiness-6-lessons-from-the-newest-research-on-income-and-well-being/267016/). Money does equal well being up to a point. There is diminishing returns on happiness to money though, but just makes for a stronger argument against a rapidly increasing income for the 1% since it won\\'t increase their well being nearly as much as it would for people with lower income. And again, it\\'s about equity. The idea that someone should be valued for the work they contribute. In theory, with an equitable society, as the economy gets stronger, everyone should benefit, and yet we only see increases in those with the highest income. We *should* live in an equitable society. The whole point of a democratic society is to be as fair to as many people as is possible, and in this regard, the system has utterly failed a huge swath of people. I\\'d say they have every right to be angry about that.  > You were falling into territory that wasn\\'t going anywhere with superlative language.  I feel pointing out your view is coming more from arrogance than logic is going somewhere pretty important, actually.  > Sure. Facebook, Go on there. Add people who post a lot of their own status\\'s. Wait.  K, so you\\'re just basing it on what \"feels\" right to you then, got it.  > \\'The 1%\\' and \\'they\\' are referring to different groups .  Yes, \"they\" is referring to the 99% movement. How is that twisting your words?  > if the 1% is over valued, then isn\\'t they (the 99%) under valued?  The two are certainly related, but the difference of phrasing is significant. As I said, most people are ok with a wealth gap, and focusing on the undervalue adds an implication that that isn\\'t the case, that everyone should be equal (as you said), while focusing on the overvalue is pointing out that there\\'s no good reason for that gap to exist, and that this isn\\'t equitable.  > Not really interested in your observer bias.  Right, but *your* observer bias is totally ok and using your facebook friends as a basis for 15 thousand people is totally fine.  > Never said they were better, but the wealthy do tend to have more say.  Say in what exactly? Politics? Society?  > I\\'m not saying they don\\'t matter. I\\'m saying they thought it of themselves as a group, and were acting out from that belief as a group.  And I\\'m saying it wasn\\'t about how much they did or didn\\'t matter, it was about the unfairness of the stupidly large wealth gap. It was the fact that in our supposedly \"all men were created equal\" society, some men born into better circumstances would result in such a dramatic and unfair situation. The point was that according to the values of this country, what is happening should not be happening. It has nothing to do with the self-worth of the 15 thousand protesters. That wasn\\'t what he said and is completely unrelated to the truth.   You can easily look up \"Occupy Wall Street\" on wikipedia, which would have saved you time. [This is the link.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement).  The protest began with some university students who were dealing with massive budget cuts in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008, despite them having paid a good deal for the hope of a good future. I don\\'t know how old you are and I don\\'t know how you missed through 2008 (I was a kid during 2008 and the news never escaped me), but things were quite *tense* at the time.   The average wealth of the mean statistical person dropped by over 30%, and a great deal of suddenly poor people were looking for people to blame. The average wealth of the former top 1% in overall wealth had only dropped 11%, meaning that the rich were for the most part minorly inconvenienced while there were many suicides in the general population relating to bankruptcy.   In this sort of situation, people thought it would be a good idea to imitate the college protests and squat on various locations. The Spanish occupied various targets (the Great Recession affected the entire world), and some weeks/months later the Americans decided to fall suit and occupy wall street. A lot of people were unemployed so it wasn\\'t as though they had anything better to do, which is why the whole trend accelerated the way it did. Perhaps if you had more money you could properly articulate your point. Or maybe I just need more money to be smart enough to understand just how deep you must be. ...no, it uses the income of various countries across the world compared to those countries reported happiness. I sincerely doubt they went around asking people \"hey compared to these countries over here which have significantly better economies than yours, how happy are you?\"  Besides, if your theory that everyone but you and the elite super smart people of the world are super entitled and too stupid to improve their lot in life, wheres your evidence to back that? So far I\\'m the only one presenting *anything* more than confirmation bias and personal anecdotes. > What my point was that the shame in existing for nothing other than being part of a machine was the catalyst for a lot of people. Not a desire for equality. But to gain a sense of meaning in their lives in a manner which is very circumspect.  And my point was that it had nothing to do with shame, or even equality for that matter. The movement was about *equity*, not equality, two very different things. Most people are totally ok with a wealth gap. Most people are not, however, totally ok with [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Inequality-by-Kenworthy.png). That\\'s an absurd growth for the upper class, and there\\'s no argument that their contribution to society is worth *that much more* than the entirety of the other 99% of the population. Until you can disprove that premise, you have no right or reason to chalk it all up to a hurt sense of self worth.  > But this is the internet  Oh, I\\'m sorry, I guess that makes baseless arrogance totally ok. Carry on /s.  > I was reflecting on the irony of how politicians are treated when the typical individual would look far worse under a spot light  Would they now? Can you back that idea up with facts or does that statement just \"feel\" right to you?  > I was especially challenging the perceived idea that they felt undervalued through democracy  And I\\'m saying they felt the 1% was *overvalued.* Not that they were undervalued.  > The 99% as a literal group will have very primitive opinions that in general do not often change and when they do it\\'s mostly because of not liking the opposition. That is a reactionary measure, not aware of its actions. Not trust-able to act in accordance with sensibility.  Again, this is equal parts arrogance and sheltering. You\\'re implying that because someone is wealthy, their opinions will naturally be more nuanced and intelligent. I have friends ranging from poor to rich, and I can assure you, I see no significant correlation to their economics and intelligence. Neither I nor my opinions are any better than any of them simply because my parents make more money than theirs. That\\'s an utterly absurd concept.',\n '',\n \"> i dunno, if it happened to your friend i think you'd be more angry than sympathetic, you'd think they were selfish.   Am I right that you'd be angry because you feel like they're putting you in a position where you have to worry about their well-being and possibly deal with the fallout resulting from their injury or death - i.e., you'd be angry that they're betraying your personal interest in favor of the interest of strangers? That's selfish of you, because you are putting your interest (not wanting to get hurt by somebody else's actions) over the interest of your friend or relative, who presumably is doing this out of their own volition, and over the interest of many other people, who presumably want to get cured of ebola, saved from fires, etc. It's kind of how people get angry at somebody who died, as part of the grieving process: you feel like the person abandoned you to deal with all these unpleasant feelings and events. It comes from a feeling of powerlessness. Eventually healthy people accept that the world doesn't revolve around their wishes, they don't have control over everything that happens, and learn to live in an atmosphere of constant unwarranted change. You said yourself that you can understand the need for this kind of work in the abstract, you're just having a difficult time bringing it home.  Being able to empathize with others and sacrifice your time, efforts, or safety in order to preserve theirs is inherent to the human condition. Leaving behind that self-centeredness and recognizing that self-preservation is not the ultimate goal is one of the marks of maturity in modern society.  An internet forum isn't going to convince you to be empathetic through reasoned argument, it is something you glean from life experience and time.  >i dunno, if it happened to your friend i think you'd be more angry than sympathetic, you'd think they were selfish. i kinda view it like that, it's weird  If I had a friend that made the choice to do something like this I would be proud of them, and try to help them be as safe as possible in their pursuit. That anger is occurring because you're placing your friends life in front of those they are sacrificing to help. Imagine instead that your friend has ebola, and that no doctors will go near them. How would you feel about the sacrifice in that situation? \",\n \"But this sadness you feel is a specific structure of brain matter inside your head, it's just emotions felt by a sack of meat. Wouldn't it be better to change the meat in your head so that it doesn't feel sad rather than eliminate all the meat in everyone else's heads? Our children are some kind of trace and peace of mind because they are something that provides for our future. They will be the voters and the citizens that make the next generation happier than the one before it... to just leave a mark means nothing if there is no purpose for it. Similarly, what use would a hunk of thinking metal be in the eternal void if there were no living thing to find it?  But why should we be actively seeking our demise when there are other arguably more viable options? This is not a case where we could go in a final blaze of glory to be remembered or forgotten, this is a case where we have the technology already to be remembered, and we could destroy ourselves pursuing something more.  If it were to destroy us, why do you think it would carry some nostalgic memory of us to the stars? Surely something that would hold that kind of wrath would hate us and want us forgotten or demonized in history. Further, the trouble with space faring as a way to preserve us in some way is the issue we have now, the Fermi Paradox. Look into it, rather interesting.  I am quite aware of Star Trek actually, but I'm still not sure why you think AI would be the best bet for a legacy? If it were something that could destroy us like that, why would it be worth risking the lives of billions of people and ending our race by choice? Why should we commit genocidal suicide like this? Would it not be simpler to ensure our legacy remains by firing space probe time capsules with enough basic logic in them to dodge debris and planets and stars towards each corner of the cosmos? Then we could tell the story we so choose, and keep ourselves alive until we die more naturally. Why not leave children in the form of monuments? Or art?  Or something else that you don't think will destroy us?\",\n '',\n '>My reasoning is that he doesn\\'t need \"Clark\" to relate to human beings.  It\\'s not about relating to human beings, \"Clark Kent\" and that whole persona is how Kal-El sees the human race. Right now, we\\'re weak, scared and just starting to bloom as a species.   Someone had a good quote with Superman and Lex Luthor, something about Superman wants us to grow as a species and join him in the Sun, but as Lex Luthor sees it, even if the Sun is huge, Superman blocks the sun and we\\'re just standing in the shade looking up at him. > My reasoning is that he doesn\\'t need \"Clark\" to relate to human beings.  He needs a human identity for humans to relate to him.  As a comparison, I\\'m a veteran of the US Military. I can tell you from experience that doing normal things, like going to the grocery store or eating at a restaurant, are very different when I was in uniform. People treat you differently, for better or worse, when you stand out as a specific person or member of a group as opposed to just another person.  Clark and Bruce would only ever be treated like superheroes if they only had their superhero personas. Superman has publicly dated Lane and is openly friends with Olsen. My reasoning is that he doesn\\'t need \"Clark\" to relate to human beings. Just take off the glasses and keep on loving them.  How about Bruce?  And, seriously, how \"normal\" of a relationship can you have when everyone knows you as \"Superman\"?  Not only do you have all of the pressure of a celebrity, the cheesy jokes that athletes need to put up with \"Keep eating like that and you won\\'t be leaping any tall buildings pal!

The counterside to this is that \"bad\" things can also move abroad. Your constitution doesn\\'t allow spying on your citizens? Spy on another\\'s, let them spy on yours, and exchange the data.  Basically, this enables randomness. The same line of thought could be used to argue that we shouldn\\'t have laws at all. American passport holders can access most countries with just their passport on arrival (same as Germany, UK, Sweden, and Finland).

Are you sure you aren\\'t just talking about Canada and Mexico? No I need a work Visa but that is just because USA is backwards. Also I said I could go almost anywhere, and I am pretty sure many Americans can\\'t go to North Korea for example. Canada, Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, and, Singapore too. I don\\'t know that any Americans are directly involved in Wikileaks. Ehhhhhhhhhh.  I can intern abroad as an America, but I\\'d have a hard time getting a PAID internship abroad. Not exactly sure why this is, but it makes me feel like working abroad isn\\'t that easy as an American. You can visit lebanon without a visa, but I need to wait a few weeks to get a visa to the USA.  then your government well find ways hide things that they don\\'t want you to see.   From my example it\\'s not fraud, but thats what the government would claim it as to get it removed.  You must give up security to live free.  I\\'m Canadian. While we share a continent, the term \"American\" only refers to the US. So how would you ensure that your world government doesn\\'t turn out more like the US and less like Canada? Dude, you\\'re just attacking this fellow for no reason. Stop it.  He wasn\\'t taking a strong stance on the issue. He was pointing it out, because he knew someone would bring it up, but said it didn\\'t really matter that much. He just considers it a minor issue. And the main *reason* that it\\'s a minor issue is that \"everybody\\'s doing it whether it\\'s legal or not.\"  >Following that logic, perhaps the Jewish genocide should\\'ve been legal because \"everyone\\'s doing it legal or not\".   *Bullshit*. The Holocaust *was* legal. If it wasn\\'t, it wouldn\\'t have happened. A better equivalency is jaywalking. If it becomes legalized, who the hell cares?  >Regardless, I don\\'t see how you came to your original conclusion that redundant efforts to protect information would essentially legalize piracy.  He wants 100% freedom of information. The government wouldn\\'t be able to remove any information from the internet, including pirated content, or be able to prosecute anyone for releasing pirated information. This also protects us from potential government censorship.  Personally I think it\\'s a bit extreme to have 100% freedom of information, and honestly idealistic, and I realize that piracy is a bit more of a complicated issue. However, he was *explicitly* trying to not take a strong stance on it. He merely mentioned it because it was very relevant, and he considered it, at the least, the lesser of two evils. What? That doesn\\'t make sense on several levels  1) If the reason your info is there is because it was stolen then it should still be illegal shouldn\\'t it?  Are you saying people can post illegal content because \"There is a reason it is there\"  2) You realize your new law also extends to child porn right? Because well there is a reason it is there and it is hosted on your property.  3) How is it fraud?  They aren\\'t misrepresenting your information in any way. That is simply the courts failing to fully uphold the law. Further, the only way to really combat that sort of corruption is for whistleblowers to leak the classified data about it to organizations outside the government\\'s reach.  Most governments have extradition treaties, on the condition that both governments consider the act in question to be bad. If they don\\'t agree, it\\'s probably best that they err on the side of caution and presume it\\'s not. Can you go and work in the US? I am sure an american can work in any country. But should it be legal to do that? ∆ I never thought of the possibility universal government could be corrupted as our governments now. I understands, now, that even if there were a universal government, its values would still be vulnerable to corruption, and could potentially have a ulterior agenda that doesn\\'t have the People as a priority.  what\\'s that have to do with the price of tea in china? That\\'s if you use the current systems. For a 1 world government you\\'ll have elected governments from all countries in debate and discussion.    Simply banning corporate influence can also help corruption too and make sure parties are focused on issues in their state rather then focusing on profit. Sincerely, mind staying on topic of your own post?  Did you post to change your view or to go offtopic? This is actually a really good question. It might be to discourage brain drain by keeping skilled workers in the U.S., but we allow people to renounce citizenship, which would allow those skilled workers to leave, anyway. I have no good answer for you, but I\\'d never thought of that. Yes, you are correct, I just knew for sure about Western Europe and thus only added the region I was sure of. By the way, are Canadians not considered to be Americans in the US?  Basically every peaceful first world country has some treaty priviliges regarding visa.  You\\'re relying very heavily on this \"system\" meant to keep people in line. Remind me, who creates and runs the system? Is it people? People capable of being corrupted? What makes you think that access to _more_ power will somehow induce those interested in acquiring it to go about things more ethically? Groups are very easy to influence.  Im also not talking about fake elections that united states have. just those system in general. You said they can post any information they want to without penalty.  So how can they commit fraud by posting your information if they aren\\'t claiming it as there own?  They are just posting your personal information without consequence.  Also just because the person probably won\\'t get caught doesn\\'t mean we should make it legal to steal and post private information. It is actually doubly complicated because the US is the only country that collects tax from citizens working in another country. Thus you would pay double the tax, once for the country you work in and once for the US.  Why do they do that by the way? What is the justification for taking your money if you are not even using any of their infrastructure or police force? Because constitutions are always held to... have you been to the US recently? Absolutely nothing would keep a world government accountable. Nothing. But just look at how parts of the US constitution are ignored. I wouldn\\'t trust a global elite to follow the rules for any long period of time People aren\\'t that free to move today. Only americans have almost unrestricted access to any country. most people around the world have to get a visa to visit a country and sometimes it is hard to get one. Only if you invade it first and build military bases. You have bases in 150 countries so yes, yes, you can work in almost every country. If that happened today you still would be fucked. Even if you get that info removed it\\'s on the internet forever anyways so you well have to change all that information and try to get it leaked next time.   I wanna make this clear, This happens already today. If you shit got posted on  wikileaks today, you well never get that put down. Thats the USA. They\\'re no longer a democracy and your vote doesn\\'t mean anything. If your vote meant anything the government wouldnt violate the constitution.  Look at steven harper in canada. That prick is starting to sell land to the chinese, allowing the NSA, and well never legalize pot. His government will not win next election i guarantee it. In the USA all you got is really 2 choices. Republican or democrat and the rich own both. Now what? Vote doesn\\'t mean anything.  Americans and Western Europeans* It\\'s said by myself and my coworkers, who are all in our early to late 20\\'s. But how does the fact that it\\'s something your grandmother would say make it any less valid as a figure of speech? Okay, so why not a global federal government, with today\\'s nations existing as strong states within it? > Only americans have almost unrestricted access to any country    Not true. As a Swede I can also go almost anywhere. Obviously, for daily life the ability to cross borders is essential. But when it comes to a lot of things involving communication or technology it just matters that the laws allow it somewhere. You can contact remote servers from anywhere far easier than you could set up and run one in an area with legal restrictions.  Over the long term, I would say that is probably where things are going. But I don\\'t think it will happen in some kind of revolutionary takeover. Instead, what will happen is that increasingly important and powerful treaties such as the Trans Pacific Partnership will be negotiated by governments to provide global regulation of trade. Over time, people will start to demand democratic accountability for the already existing international governmental structure. That is because of treaties.

Magical words on special paper won\\'t change that Pretty sure most Americans have to get visas to visit other countries.  Yeah, one day, but not this day.

We can\\'t even stop hating on the brown guy next door let alone come together as a united and boundary-less global human race bent on the thriving of mankind. Fingers crossed 22nd century.  The point was that this is because these countries agreed to do this and any country can agree with another to have these arrangements.  They cannot. They need to apply for a work visa like everyone else. thats because the USA is an oligarchy and not a democracy. The USA works for benefiting the rich over the whole population.  Ok so I steal your SIN number, your banking information, address and all other personal information and post it online.  Do you want it removed? Because under your law it can stay up no matter what. Governments always slowly increase their power.  You could devise the best constitution ever written.  You could set up a perfect government.  But, it wouldn\\'t last.    Little by little, bits of the constitution will come to be ignored.  Slowly, this government will claim more power for itself.  That\\'s what always happens.   i hate people like you who like to twist words. thats not what i said.   I say there has to a be a information legislation to protect freedom of speech and to hold information that can be used against party officials. this well prohibit searches and seizures of servers.   a side effect of said legislation would be the legalization of piracy which really doesn\\'t matter because people pirate the shit out of everything legal or not. Another side effect can be child porn which can easily made as an exception that requires lots of judicial attention when upholding the law on that regard.   That is a nice definition of \"working in a foreign country\". Just be military personell stationed there! I was pointing out it wasn\\'t archaic, but you\\'re right, nothing was said about the validity of the statement. 0) use common sense instead of acting like you know nothing  1) If you make that info illegal to post, it will be illegal to hold financial information of party officials. If you get your credit card and shit posted online today anyways, the perpetrator probably won\\'t get caught and your fucked and have to change your shit regardless.   2) To be completely fair if you have child porn on your computer, you should be allowed to have it, even as dirty and shitty as that sounds. As least you\\'re just fapping and not raping a child.   The people who should be detained are those who produce said child porn.  3) Fraud is not misrepresenting. Its a form of identity theft relating to your financials. More accurately from wiki: \"wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain\" I would say the abolishing IP isn\\'t equivalent to socialism because it is an artificial property right if you will. Property rights are a social construct that emerged to ameliorate conflict over scarce goods: that\\'s a nice chair/table/car--maybe we will end up fighting for its ownership.  Ideas are not scarce. Neither are mp3 files. They should not be artificially made so. If you want to be a full time musician etc. it is up to you to find ways to make that pay--merch, gigs etc. Same goes for film industry That does not discount the fact if there is such a world government there MUST be a protection of information in the constitution. Essentially making it a constitutional right to host whatever information you want on your property. Along with the constitutional right to express this information to peers without penalty(modified first amendment of USA). And EVERY interaction between party officials must be recorded and stored on multiple hosts.   That would probably legalize piracy...but really when it comes to human rights who the fuck cares except for the rich media companies. if there is no such system in place a world government WELL become corrupt. All of those passports are exceptional. I\\'ve an Indian one and it\\'s worthless.  Think of it this way, who is getting screwed in the world atm?  I would say some parts of china, some parts of india, some parts of africa, some parts middle east. Turns out this areas are home to over 50% of the population.   If the government continues to be dicks heads these people well vote them out.   Im not talking about fake elections that united states have.  Just like \"Australian\" doesn\\'t apply to New Zealanders. ',\n 'I\\'m from Missoula, Montana and currently live in San Diego, California. Montana is absolutely beautiful, the people are nice and very liberal in missoula (other cities not so much). California is always pegged as this amazing and liberal place....but I don\\'t see it that way. They have weird laws and taxes and it is very expensive to live in most parts of California. I would honestly try and stay away from bigger cities. I will admit I am a little bit of a small town girl, but in my opinion, bigger cities are the scary thing. I can get around easily here and have made some great friends and found a job fairly quickly, but there are things about California that are absurd to me after growing up in such an amazing place. I think as long as you understand what sort of resources you can utilize in America, it can be a really great place. Although we have a lot of improvements to make, it probably isn\\'t as scary as the media makes it out to be. Be wary, but not too wary! Of course there are terrible people and policies anywhere you go, so just do your research, don\\'t come into it blindly, but come take advantage of some opportunites and meet some people who would love to make a new friend from the Netherlands!  And as far as the healthcare thing goes, a lot of jobs offer healthcare benefits, although it would be nice for everyone to receive benefits, but hopefully we will make strides with that in the near future. There are a lot of government and nonprofit organizations that will help you out if you need it. Like i said, as long as you know about your resources, you will be just fine! Hopefully you get a chance to come to Montana! You won\\'t be disappointed:-) Anne Arundel County in MD is the best, only a few hours from NYC and an hour from DC As an Ausitinite: definitely look into Austin. It\\'s absolutely booming, and it\\'s a really cool place to live. It\\'s the small spot of blue in a large sea of red though, if politics are important to you... (Tons of people move here from California and it\\'s become even more liberal. In fact, it\\'s become a running joke around here.)  Both are huge states with big differences between cities. LA and San Francisco for example will have different outlooks on life due to the large distances between them and local culture. Rules/laws change a bit between cities in the same state but not as much as laws between different states. Rural Texas and areas like Dallas are going to be a lot more conservative compared to Austin or San Antonio. Texas will be a lot cheaper than California,   The thing to remember about the U.S. is that there is a aversion to being forced into things. So things like healthcare reform have been controversial, as if you want to choose to not have health insurance, you can choose to do that. So there are people out there that chose not to, get in an accident, and end up with massive bills. On the other hand, there used to be fairly lax laws into what counts as \"insurance\" that was offered through shitty companies. If you had a plan like that, they could basically deny everything. The Obamacare stuff took care of a lot of this, and I\\'d bet that there will be more reform in the next 5-10 years as the system gets stressed by the aging baby boomer population here.  Out of curiosity, which state and city is interesting for you? > but the thing that makes me thing its a scary place to live in is that you cant be sure that you will be able to live the life you\\'re used to in case of a major illness or anything that will cost you a lot of money.  Sure you can.  That\\'s what insurance is for.  It\\'s different than most other first world countries since it\\'s something you opt-in to instead of automatically receiving, but it\\'s not exactly hard to come by, and it\\'s a pretty common choice to make to buy it.',\n '>But, beyond that, I don\\'t think in nature predator species literally rape and enslave prey species.

This results in the monument having greater influence than not. It results in something rather than the lack of something. That makes it empirically better.  >This is the opposite of what you\\'re talking about. Pax Americana exists because the US does not take from those that weaker, it protects the weak from those that would take from them. The right of conquest is no longer an accepted means of territorial acquisition.   This... actually requires consideration. Thank you for that. Allow me a while for reflection.   > I don\\'t beleive it is possible  Not possible? How about... World War II for example? And worse things are imaginable.  And what you linked is mostly beside the point. The general trend might be, - for us, now - towards less violence. This does not mean anything close to the claim that that all possible societies with more technology are happier. So you didn\\'t answer my question.     I\\'m glad you\\'ve started using \"to me\" and \"in my mind\".  But you can\\'t just impose your concepts of worth on others - especially at their expense.  Or at least, if you think it\\'s okay to, I also disagree with you there.    >This makes the creator more capable than the other, and thus better.  No, it does not follow. This is very explicitly \"might is right\".   >A society with superior technology but more suffering? I don\\'t beleive it is possible.  This is the opposite of what you\\'re talking about. Pax Americana exists because the US does *not* take from those that weaker, it *protects* the weak from those that would take from them. The right of conquest is no longer an accepted means of territorial acquisition.  > In that, their influence extends beyond death.   Pretty much every living thing extends its influence beyond death. It\\'s called biological reproduction. Even single-celled organisms do it. I don\\'t quite understand how \"building a monument\" is somehow superior a means of exerting influence beyond your death than producing more of your species with your particular genes.  >The more technology a society has, the more capable they become.  More capable of... what? What is \"better\"? Better for whom? Less capable than what?   >As predators consume prey to thrive...  So, wait a second? Stronger civilizations should *prey* upon weaker ones? You know, I\\'m pretty sure we tried that and it led to global instability and a shit ton of wars between the \"predator\" states.  Because, the one thing about predators is that they have to constantly fight their competition for their rights to the pray.  But, beyond that, I don\\'t think in nature predator species literally rape and enslave prey species. But whatever. This is missing my original the point.  There had been periods of history (as long or short as you like) with more happiness than during WWII. It doesn\\'t even have to be across the entire world. OP said it wasn\\'t possible to have more technology and less happiness in any society.  The whole trend of violence across history etc is relevant overall but also a different matter to my original question to him. >Not possible? How about... World War II for example? And worse things are imaginable. And what you linked is mostly beside the point. The general trend might be, - for us, now - towards less violence. This does not mean anything close to the claim that that all possible societies with more technology are happier. So you didn\\'t answer my question.  Allow me to better attempt to answer: Yes, the replacement with the unhappy, more advanced society is the best thing to do. I believe technology has the great potential to alleviate suffering, and I have not seen evidence to the contrary of that potential. Yes, there are cases of suffering because of technology, but I find they are outweighed by the massive gains. You\\'re forgetting the huge numbers of people alive during World War II who didn\\'t die.  Even if you factor in both world wars and all the state-caused famines of the 20th century, the overall death rate (percentage of people who were killed) doesn\\'t even approach Genghis Khan, let alone prehistoric humanity (which was actually ridiculously violent). > How about happiness? Maybe peace? If you could take today\\'s society and replace it with one with greater technological superiority, but where on the whole people were less happy and there was more war/murder/etc. do you really think this would be the right thing to do? And if so then why? I certainly don\\'t.  A society with superior technology but more suffering? [I don\\'t beleive it is possible](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904106704576583203589408180). Happiness, to me, equates to fulfillment, which further extends to what you can achieve. Technology substantially increases what we are able to achieve. In my mind, I equate societies with more technology as more capable, and therefore more happy.  >I think this is one such misplaced sense of meaning. It\\'s like a religious people saying to a nonreligious person \"I actually did something meaningful with my life\" because they followed God or whatever. Any sense of meaning related to building wonders is constructed by us. Which is fine, but it\\'s not the only one. If we were all happy and lived fulfilling lives in peace etc. then I wouldn\\'t use the fact that we could/couldn\\'t build wonders as a sign of our success.   Again, I disagree. If someone happy does nothing, they are forgotten after their death. If someone unhappy builds a monument, that monument exists past their death. In that, their influence extends beyond death. This makes the creator more capable than the other, and thus better. Ideally the creator would also live a happy life as well as build the monument.  >(1) Why advances in science are the measure of a societies worth?   The more technology a society has, the more capable they become. It can boil down quite simply to empirical data. A more capable society is better than one who is less capable.   >(2) This somehow gives a society justification for harming others in order to achieve that goal?   In the end, yes. As predators consume prey to thrive, a superior society can consume a lesser one to advance. It is the nature, and reality of the world, and I place value on that.  ',\n '',\n '',\n ' This is the logical conclusion. The ideal system is one where college costs a lot less  because of  government  sponsorship. Look at Europe  Living in society is an agreement to pay taxes as the other people in the society want the benefit of it. The people who don\\'t are in a minority.  There are plenty of things I pay taxes for I don\\'t like. Such as War. Yeah, but you\\'re also a soft-dictatorship, so... I read your whole reply, but I\\'m just going to comment on a couple points.  You seem to be implying that colleges *want* to raise tuition.  They don\\'t. With very few exceptions they aren\\'t making more money. They raise tuition because in order to compete for students they need to spend more money.  The larger problem with your argument is that colleges are subsidized by taxpayers who paid for their own college and don\\'t have kids.  I think we agree that that is a good thing, but it means you can\\'t accurately say that you are giving yourself a loan. You are getting a loan from people who have already paid for their education.  If college becomes free for everyone then there will be drastically more pressure from taxpayers without kids to cut back on college services and to limit studies to areas that will be of immediate economic benefit to the public.  That isn\\'t what is best for students.  > I don\\'t pay a premium to use a public road or a public park that are funded with tax dollars.  There are many public roads and parks that have usage fees. In most aspects of public life we try to balance charging the general public and charging the specific people who use the public service.  Some transportation funding comes from general taxes some comes from gas taxes or car registrations.  We generally try to make these services accessible to everyone, but cost a bit more for those who benefit the most from them. I know how public schools in the US work. Nothing you said refutes my point, other than the fact that you started with the word \"no.\" > sure they pay for phone and car insurance and a place to sleep, but that\\'s not much considering it\\'s you know, their fucking child.  I pay for all those things myself. I live in a cheap area, so rent + utilities is about $350. Phone and car insurance are a little over $100 a month. That\\'s right around the $5500 a year that a Pell Grant gives you.  For the insurance and tax purposes, there are clear drawbacks that include the higher cost of paying for additional insurance coverage, as well as the fact that dependent for tax purposes cuts out a large amount of potential return for the child in question.  There are plenty of compelling reasons 18 years should be the age of financial adulthood, including: the ability to receive a credit card and rack up massive debt, the ability to join the armed forces, and the ability to pack up and straight-off leave the USA to not deal with it at all. Just because social trends, a greater emphasis on attending a 4-year than ever, and a poor job market have resulted in a higher percentage of young people living with their parents for a while doesn\\'t necessarily mean we should radically shift the legal system around this, much less force this legally-binding assumption upon all young people and deny them comparable finances unless they find a way to break out of \"traditional\" status.  Know what\\'s silly? The fact that a Veteran with a contract that has 1 day of Active Duty outside of training purposes is considered independent the day they finish training, but a Veteran that finishes the same training and heads home the day after finishing training and goes to a Reserve/Guard unit is considered a dependent. ONLY by the Department of Education for the purpose of the FAFSA amongst ALL government agencies does this definition apply.  21-year-old Guardsmen/Reservists that are without spouse/child (like I was) have the double-whammy of being subjected to labels of independence and dependence simultaneously within this system, and being impossible to get the tax returns of my deadbeat parents to complete my FAFSA, it was sheer luck that I was getting married that year so I could be independent (thankfully I have a wonderful wife two years older than myself that also wanted to marry young). This may sound like an obscure situation, but it\\'s not. Turns out there are a lot of college-aged people in the Guard/Reserves.  So we deal with the hands-tied aspect of supposed semi-ignorance and dependence on our parents while also having the \"deal with it/figure it out\" side that a responsible adult should have. As it turns out, not every adult has responsible parents, and it\\'s unfair to assume that a responsible student has responsible parents. Responsible people have the documentation required to file a FAFSA. My parents weren\\'t, and even then it\\'s not fair to assume that every parent wants to throw around their tax return to a kid that left the house when they graduated high school and wanted to live life as an independent adult.  It\\'s not fair to adults to force them to feign and legally agree with dependence upon their parents because of the way the system currently works, despite the fact that some people truly are dependents, because so many others of us are 100% independent and can\\'t receive so much as a tax return from our parents to fill out our aid forms. The system lacks flexibility and it\\'s a well-known shortfall at this point that is entirely in-line with OPs rhetoric.  A line needs to be drawn somewhere, and the age of voting or being able to leave the country or, you know, GO TO COLLEGE ought to be the age where people are able to be considered independent enough to be treated as somebody, you know, over the age of majority that, you know, is going to college. If you\\'re old enough to attend without your parents holding your hand and old enough to receive potentially life-crippling debt for it without your parents holding your hand, you should be old enough to receive aid for it without your parents holding your hand.  In my opinion, that is. They already charge reasonable tuition.  The schools halls are brimming with willing takers, all of which are paying something.  The universities have pretty good formulas to determine how much each person can afford.  Rich people get $0 in grants.  Poor people get very good grant/loan packages.   Why would it look like a dictatorship? A public university is a branch of the government. Yes, it is owned, funded, and administered by the state of Tennessee similarly to how the public schools are owned, funded, and administered by the state of Tennessee. It\\'s fascinating that this is even in question. Yes its owned and operated and funded by the state government. Its government property Oh my god, get out. I hate that.  My dad makes a lot NOW, but has had many times of unemployment and my family has had a lot of medical bills over the years that we couldn\\'t prevent.  So we\\'re fucked for need based scholarships.   Yes, they definitely made more than the median household income. But I\\'m honestly not sure there was much wiggle room even after the lifestyle changes they made. Sure they weren\\'t going out for drinks with friends anymore. But they still had a mortgage to pay, two dependents at home to support, etc. Cost of living is not cheap in their area (philly suburbs). There were probably expenses they could have cut back on more but I can\\'t say for sure as I was distracted with getting my own finances in order. And the two dependents didn\\'t know about the job losses for a while, so maybe they were keeping up appearances so the dependents\\' day to day wasn\\'t disrupted. I think at first with severance and savings they gambled on finding jobs quickly while being more frugal than usual and not contributing to savings anymore, but the job market was rougher than anticipated. So while the FAFSA calculation may be consistently applied to all applicants, it does not take into account cost of living variations (but that\\'s a whole other issue). At $100k gross income, regardless of income source, FAFSA was saying they should be contributing over $40k for the year. That itself is pretty crazy when you factor in cost of living.   Anyway. I shared my experience to highlight an example of when the FAFSA dependency status is bullshit. Quite simply, if the IRS says you\\'re independent then so should FAFSA.  But the complete opposite it\\'s what is actually happening. Universities charge so much because they can.  Because almost nobody is denied a loan.  It\\'s our next bubble.  It\\'s also causing a devaluation of degrees. The German way is awesome. Heavily subsidized. I would gladly pay more in taxes if I knew future generations would be able to pay  $1k a semester for school.  No, it\\'s not at all like that. They\\'ll pay their taxes and contribute, and they\\'ll hopefully get a return on that.  Why do you assume they won\\'t pay any taxes? What is a \\'soft-dictatorship\\'? That\\'s pretty much how taxes works, yeah.  I\\'m against the international wars/conflicts the US is involved in, but I still pay for them, since I\\'m a citizen. Is it moral? Just? Legitimate? No, but it\\'s the burden I pay to be able to exist in the system. I shouldn\\'t have to cite, its sad this isn\\'t common sense. *PUBLIC* university. [Wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university) Speak for yourself, I am in Med School for free, and getting paid by the government for it. And I find it to be excellent education. Do the governments of almost every European country look like dictatorships? Thanks! I agree it\\'s not perfect, maybe not the best. Still, what about one kid with parents who can barely afford to feed her/him and can\\'t  pay for college  versus another kid who has been well taken care of, even spoiled, but the parents won\\'t pay for college? Surely people will be fucked over either way. Are there so many wealthy parents denying their kids the care they are able to provide that your way would help more than the current system? 2nd amendment. I mean most other countries already do, but the constitution and things like the NRA won\\'t let that happen sadly. > they may as well take guns away because we might shoot each other with them  Not to be snarky, but what\\'s wrong with that? We do shoot each other with them... lots. It\\'s not that some people might abuse it. The objection is that if it\\'s possible, almost every single family will use it. That means the family contribution will almost always be zero. So financial aid will be the same for all students, which is just another way of saying it won\\'t exist. If you can file independently on taxes for every other form of government assistance but not on FAFSA. That is where I meant the double standard.   >19-23 year olds are financially depended on their parents or even live with their parents.  Yeah, so? If they aren\\'t independent adults then they can\\'t legally claim to be on their taxes either so this doesn\\'t really mean we should screw over the ones that can legally file independent on taxes.   Plus even if you still live with parents does not mean they support OR that they will pay for college.    One of the reasons the costs of uni have increased is due to less and less gov funding over the past 40 years.  If the system requires a perfect leader in charge for it to work then it is not a good system to support.  I\\'m fairly certain that \"public university\" implies that the institution is A: not for profit (to contrast it with a private institution such as Full Sail or DeVry) and B: subject to state and federal education regulations as a public university such as rules against discrimination, accepting grant/loan money from students, or filing very specific paper work. In return for being public (and meeting certain standards) the university is eligible to get government grant money or allow its degrees to be considered equivalent with other universities which offer equivalent degrees.  It\\'s not public in the same way that a park is public or a library is public, nor is it private in the way that a business is private or a residence is private. It\\'s not really the property of the state or run by the government; it\\'s run according to its own officials and policies in so far as the existing rules it agrees to follow allow it to flexibly make those decisions on its own (such as who to hire or what they will charge for tuition). Using the word \"public\" in front of universities isn\\'t meant to imply the same relationship as when its used for the \"public broadcasting service\" or even in the same way that the Postal Service is public. It\\'s meant to contrast with the idea of a private university - which would be one that isn\\'t regulated by the government. They purport to teach, declare that criteria for degrees have been met, and charge for their services and their students hope that when they leave, someone thinks what they learned was valuable. Since the quality of the education wasn\\'t held to national standards, there\\'s not a lot of confidence that a private college inspires for some people.  Another discussion on the topic from the Wall Street Journal:  http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324549004579068992834736138  >  WSJ: Why does college cost so much?  > DR. FICHTENBAUM: One of the most important factors driving price at public colleges and universities has been the decline in state support for higher education. Between 1987 and 2012, in real dollars, government support has declined from $8,497 to $5,906 per student.  > The second major culprit is rising costs. Critics of higher education often blame faculty salaries for rising costs. However, when measured in constant dollars, salaries for full-time faculty at public institutions have actually declined. What is driving costs is the metastasizing army of administrators with bloated salaries, and our university presidents who are now paid as though they were CEOs running a business—and not a very successful one at that.  > There is also the growth in entertainment spending and spending on amenities. Many universities claim that they must compete and therefore have borrowed millions to build luxury dorms, new dining halls and rock-climbing walls. They also spend millions subsidizing intercollegiate athletics. Well 26 as a federal number is new, but \"kids\" being on their parents insurance through college isn\\'t new in most states. Yeah. I\\'m 24 now and there\\'s just really nothing for me now. I don\\'t know what would transfer and I\\'d probably have to start over so by the time I got to gradschool no one would want me. There\\'s a time and place to give up and that time and place is now. Here in the UK, the government sets an upper limit on tuition fees. They have dramatically raised it recently, but that in particular isn\\'t seen as something that affects universities academic independence. The government also provides all students with an interest free loan that covers these tuition fees along with a certain amount of living expenses. Students from poorer families or who are independent of their parents get a larger loan (and have improved access to bursaries), but even those whose parents earn quite a lot can get something. I don\\'t think this is an ideal system (I\\'d much prefer to return to the previous system where higher education was free and the government gave students grants to live) but, in my opinion, it works better than the US system for many students. No need to equivocate. A public university like any other public institution is controlled by the government. It has little to do with funding and a lot to do with the fact the institutions was started and is administered by the government. Edit: frankly all universities and colleges receive some measure of public funding, including for-profit ones. It used to be 24 iirc, point still stands. This is a tangent, but...  > somehow force universities to charge reasonable tuition instead of the incredibly inflated tuition we have now due to Pell Grants and such  There is a *hint* of truth in that, but overall it is shortsighted. The real question you need to answer is: what services do *you* want to *cut*?  Tuition is rising because costs are rising and because students and parents are demanding better and more expensive services. If you want to lower tuition you need to focus on where money is spent, not how students get their tuition money. Pell Grants mean that students don\\'t immediately care as much about inefficiencies but simply cutting funding won\\'t necessarily result in an outcome you like.  I did the math for my college, and I calculated that it\\'d take 1/11 of their yearly government allocated budget to pay for all the undergraduate students, free ride. I think they can certainly afford it, since that doesn\\'t include individual applied grants of the profs tp fund their own research. But my college is in California, and Cali is rich.  There are a lot of people who are morally against government handouts, if the GOP is to be believed. At any rate, I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to decry this because of a free rider problem. Free riders are an issue is every welfare/safety net/road system etc. and simply saying its too difficult to think of a way to regulate this and make it work is a bull shit excuse  What? Classroom interaction and discussion is one of, if not the most important tool used to stimulate the mind and influence how we learn.  One of the major drawbacks of online schools, IMO. A college only has undergraduate programs as far as I know. The problem was you said \"since they are public universities\" but that came out of nowhere. I don\\'t know why all the sudden the discussion was just about public universities. You\\'re not really addressing the one and only reason that financial aid is based on parents\\' ability to pay regardless of their willingness to pay:   There is absolutely no incentive to pay for college as a wealthy parent if your child merely has to state their financial independence. Until YOU can prove that this wouldn\\'t be a problem in the current system, you\\'re essentially just complaining about how life isn\\'t fair.   The problem is that parents very rarely decide they will not fund their students education, but their children still go to expensive private colleges or out of state universities (as opposed to seeking scholarships or less expensive in state universities). Parents decide to not pay for a lot of things for their kids. The difference between poor and rich parents, though, is that not only will the rich kid have more opportunity throughout their life completely apart from how much their parents fund college, they\\'re also going to inherit a lot more than the poor children. There can be better systems, but if you would like to disregard them in this discussion, YOU need to state how funding for actually needy families would not be split and massively reduced in order to give the money to everyone. Taxes and the government are good for everybody. And yes the majority has more say but how else could we do it? Let the people who want roads pay for them? well guess what, you didn\\'t pay for them, you don\\'t get to use them. Good luck leaving your house. You also don\\'t get to use businesses that utilize the fact that we have roads to obtain their items.  There are a lot of things that society pays for that is for the betterment of everyone\\'s situation.  If you really don\\'t want to pay taxes then don\\'t be apart of society. Go live in the woods or a jungle somewhere and live off the land. But right now, you use roads, police, firemen, and a large amount of other things taxes pay for.  Tuition at public schools is rising mostly because State Governments have cut funding for higher education.  I think you are drastically overestimating the percent of tuition that is paid for by federal aid.  If you want a truly \"fair\" system from the perspective of students then the government should pay for the cost of higher education--but that\\'s incredibly unfair to the taxpayers who paid for their own education and don\\'t have kids.  I think you should abandon your abstract idea of fair and start thinking more about the actual implications of the ideas you are proposing. If we adopted your proposal, nearly every wealthy family would cut off financial support for their kids at age 18. That would mean the government would be spending more on tuition and would end up spending more on food stamps and other assistance for teenagers who could easily be cared for by their parents. So who should pay for those teenagers?  I don\\'t have any problem with increasing financial aid for students, but we shouldn\\'t pretend that the money comes from nowhere. The Monarchy. You file your parents info because the government, before it passes out governmental funds, wants to see what type of potential for parental support there is.     I mean there is a limited amount of funds. If rich families could work the system so that they could have the government pay for their school why wouldn\\'t they? These families are smart. Why pay for school if the government could just do if you declare your kid as independent. Why wouldn\\'t they work the system if they could? Another way of organising it is to have the university as a charity that receives government funding under certain conditions (such as reasonable tuition costs). What logic is that exactly? Seriously? There are a lot of things my tax dollars go to that I don\\'t agree with. But if the majority wanted are tax dollars to go to public higher education, then it should. And people who do believe that they should are free to advocate for it.  Point is you don\\'t need consent from all parties involved just from enough people to vote someone into office. Having a more educated work force that isn\\'t buried under mountains of debt when they start their working life is good for society. And I believe that is why the government should help out a lot more.  *I\\'m not the person you replied to I don\\'t think \"ownership\" is the right word either. At least in California, the UC system receives (some) funding from the government but is controlled by the Board of Regents, which are appointed by the governor. However that doesn\\'t mean they are directly under his control at all; recently they raised tuition against his will.  Also, the universities are not directly tied to the federal government, which would make it impossible for the aid to come in the form of just waiving tuition fees. The end result of this aid, and unfortunately the fundamental problem with the entire system in the United States, is that all universities (especially private ones) will use it to simply raise tuition prices. It\\'s true though, the government regulates pretty much everything over there... The interest rate is basically set to match the rate of inflation though, until you start repayments anyway (a new-ish innovation that might change again). It\\'s currently 1.5%, which is much better than any bank loan, and in 2009/2010 it was 0%. sorry, on my phone it looked like i responded to the wrong comment so i deleted it :/ I\\'ll try to find what I actually said  edit: I GOT IT!!  >Yeah, I completely agree that it\\'s not gonna be fair 100% percent of the time. But nothing\\'s gonna be fair 100% of the time. We just need to do the best we can with the information we can and, on average, I would bet way more lower class kids would benefit from getting a leg up getting into college than middle/upper class kids would. I mean, if you\\'re applying to college right out of high school, the entirety of your life has been determined by your parents for the last 18 years. Those are some pretty god damn important periods of your life; having a wealthy family that can provide you with all your necessities and then some makes a HUGE difference. Are there rich parents who neglect their kids during this time? Sure. But there\\'s got to be WAY more kids on the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum that are negatively affected and so will have a harder time with ANYTHING they want to do straight out of high school than those on the middle/high end. Once again, definitely an imperfect system. But we still need to consider what the most good we can do is, where we can do it the most. In Wisconsin the state put a freeze on tuition. The University of Wisconsin system\\'s tuition is capped at the 2013 (or 2012) price indefinitely. This might just be in-state tuition... Simply because of time right now, I will provide retort that in addition to slashing direct funding of universities by the states, the Higher Education Act of 1973 guaranteeing student loans for all to cover their whole education meant that universities could inflate tuition to whatever rate they wanted and students could pony it up.   At this point in time, many young Americans will go to college, and if America can give Wall Street a bailout to the tune of 700 billion dollars, if it can afford to service the loans, it can afford to shift that money to the universities instead, and there are now two generations of Americans that have been burdened under the system established in 1973.   Once Gen X/Millenials start to run Congress, I think we\\'ll see more reformation-minded rhetoric reflected. The current Baby Boomers had the benefit of the old systems and took it for granted, and decided to slash it when they got in control because they no longer benefited from it but rather paid into it in the form of taxation.  The difference between 50 years ago and now in the University of Wisconsin system (my own) is that universities would get ~50% of their money from the government then directly, ~50% other sources. Now the amount received directly from government is ~21%. So despite the government being unable to pay the university directly, they pay the student so the university dictates the price. It sounds backwards because it is, particularly when you consider that the government loans are coming from taxpayer dollars that the student and their family pay into.   It\\'s as if the government decided that instead of giving you something with your money, they decided to loan your money to you with interest while another entity funded with your money (both tax dollars and now loans) names the amount with no reason except how high they can go. The government can give us our money back in the form of a loan (which is paid for by our tax dollars), but will not do so in the form of directly funding the university, despite the fact that now student loan debt is a hindrance to the economy. Certainly there\\'s the federal vs. state government providing the funding, but there\\'s no reason the federal government couldn\\'t provide the funding gap.  America has no excuse at this point with the amount of money we have. It\\'s a shame and an embarrassment that because of our choice to allow education costs to spiral out of control that we have so much student loan debt. Great nations don\\'t look at the cost of things as important as education, they look at the cost and the benefit. America was this way once, going to the Moon in a decade. We had things to be proud of and we knew that the benefit outweighed the cost. Things like the Space Race would be unthinkable now because of budgetary constraints created by political rhetoric.  The reason universities are so expensive at this point is because of that slashing and because now they can name their price and people pay. If the government dictated the terms and covered the entirety (making student attendance a non-factor in the university\\'s ability to fund itself), we\\'d remove the two-fold reason the price inflated (this inflated price is of course what led to the massive debt).  The FAFSA is the only government form that assumes 18-year-olds are dependents still. Few families truly pay any sizable sum in practice as it is, and of course private universities would be unaffected as they do their own thing and the attendants are from families that generally choose to pay the premium for the education offered. Aside from this, covering the full cost at public universities will mean higher application rates as well as no need for the university to excessively market ($5 million dollar football/basketball coaches) as they don\\'t profit more per-head as they did before, forcing them to be more competitive academically to get the brightest kids, as well as raising the bar for entry as now many individuals with intelligence but unwilling to go due to the price point have been given a ticket.  Education should not be seen as a \"service\", it should be seen as an investment crucial to national economic and strategic interests. Pissing all over our would-be entrepreneurs with a mountain of debt, disengaging many people that could contribute to society with more value... We have no excuse at this point. The price of public university attendance should not matter what the family situation of a student is, dependent or independent (as it should not exist except marginally) as it is government-run and serviced by tax dollars (directly through subsidy and indirectly through loans paid with tax dollars).  My point is that students\\' status should not matter at all. I don\\'t pay a premium to use a public road or a public park that are funded with tax dollars. It would be absurd if I had to take a massive loan paid with tax dollars to cover a certificate allowing me to drive on a road paid for with tax dollars. Yet this is what we do to our young people that are trying to become greater contributors to society. The problem in this conversation is that while most people are talking about how to cover the increasing cost of tuition, the correct question in my opinion is asking how we get rid of the cost in the first place in a system that lends our tax money back to us with interest to pay for an institution we already pay for with taxes. If the university\\'s education is worth it, we will get that money back in the form of higher income tax as those individuals make more, as well as the societal dividends of a more educated populace and the greater tech and management we receive. If a university\\'s education is not worth it, we can shut it down and make education more competitive. Attendance should not be based on ability to pay, it should be based on ultimate ability to contribute to society. Private universities are one thing, but public universities are publicly financed, and thus the funding body should have a say in its tuition fees.  Yes, because I benefit from this as well. You\\'re advocating for economic conservatism, these ideas aren\\'t anything new. What are you talking about, then? Anarchy? Yeah. My dad had a month-long stay earlier in the year at Ross Heart Hospital in Ohio. It\\'s very expensive. Very. Very. Expensive. Last i asked he said it was at a quarter of a million dollars but not everything had come in yet.  The trade off is that he\\'s still alive. Saint Anne\\'s was giving him a week to live. They pretty much said that \"There\\'s nothing we can do. He has a week\" It is incredibly unfair that people have different parents and some are more helpful than others.  That unfairness doesn\\'t start when someone applies to college, but it certainly is exacerbated at that point.  > Just because social trends, a greater emphasis on attending a 4-year than ever, and a poor job market have resulted in a higher percentage of young people living with their parents for a while doesn\\'t necessarily mean we should radically shift the legal system around this  The current system is that most people are not considered financially independent at 18.  I realize you are arguing that they *should* be, but it is not a shift to consider 20-year-old students dependent on their parents.  Realistically, to fund an education, 20-year-olds are going to be dependent on someone--either their parents or the government.  I have no objection to increasing government funding for higher education, but if that is what you want, you need to convince the public that it is worth paying for.  A huge reason tuition at public universities is going up is [that states are cutting funding for higher education](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324549004579068992834736138).  Bear in mind, if we make it easy for 18-year-olds to become legally financially independent for the purpose of getting financial aid, the number of people doing this will skyrocket and the number of families helping their kids pay for college will plummet. In the US, the words \"college\" and \"university\" are interchangeable. They all imply higher education programs which involve 4 years of study to get a degree. Most colleges/universities are public, yet still charge exorbitant amounts of money in tuition.  > Tuition has risen due to exorbitant overflow of unmanaged federal aid.  Federal aid is one factor, but federal aid hasn\\'t skyrocketed in recent years. If you want to find a real solution to this problem you need to stop pretending that is the only factor.  Here is one short article on the issue: http://www.npr.org/2014/03/18/290868013/how-the-cost-of-college-went-from-affordable-to-sky-high  And a relevant quotation:  > As family income fell, borrowing to pay for college took off, while public investment in higher education dropped. Sandy Baum of the Urban Institute says that drop has been the single biggest reason for the increase in college costs.  > \"So it\\'s not that colleges are spending more money to educate students,\" Baum says. \"It\\'s that they have to get that money from someplace to replace their lost state funding — and that\\'s from tuition and fees from students and families.\"  It is also worth realizing that as long as there is demand for expensive education, colleges will have high tuition. If the feds stopped helping with loans, private companies would fill the gap--at least for the kids of middle and upper-class families. Maybe the distinctions are radically different state by state then. The situation you described for BU as being definitely not a public university is exactly the way the public university I attend is run. > The issue is partly that the government has a double standard of when they consider you an independent adult.   That isn\\'t really the case--there are *many* different standards for adulthood.   People can be on their parents\\' insurance until age 26. [Parents can claim students as a dependent for tax purposes until they are 24.](http://www.irs.gov/Help-&-Resources/Tools-&-FAQs/FAQs-for-Individuals/Frequently-Asked-Tax-Questions-&-Answers/Filing-Requirements,-Status,-Dependents,-Exemptions/Dependents-&-Exemptions/Dependents-&-Exemptions-2) 20-year-olds can\\'t legally drink.  Adulthood is a very complicated issue and there is no compelling reason that 18 should be the age of financial adulthood, particularly since so many 19-23 year olds *are* financially depended on their parents or even live with their parents. Apples and oranges. Taxes are voluntarily paid to a legitimate authority while protection money is paid to an illegitimate one.   >Good. Parents are under no obligation to pay for their children\\'s higher education funds.   Neither is the government or my tax dollars In the end, both kids are facing the same end situation: the costs of college without any parental support.  Their access to financial aid through FAFSA will depend purely on something they have no individual control over, even if it has no effect on their current financial status.  Sure, some *may* have been spoiled in the past, but FAFSA does not deny aid to someone whose parents were filthy rich until they were 15 before suddenly losing most of their money in a market crash or business failure.  FAFSA does not take into account historical parental assets or earnings, so why should it take into account historical parental contributions? The UK student loans are definitely not interest free, but repayment is capped at a percentage of income, making them in effect a graduate tax. The wrong kind of  government interference. Well since they are public universities, their costs should already be directly administered by the government.    It doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re keen or not on the idea. It will happen. The same families that work the system so that they have to pay only capital gain taxes rather than income tax will work the system so that the state supports their child going to school.   The entire system of financial aid that we do have is based on a certain about of parents providing financial support for their kids. Financial aid is a finite amount. The bean counters have to count on the fact that some money will come from the and that money will be supported by money that comes from parents. If you create a way that people can game the system, and they will, then that can throw the balance out of whack.   And at that point it would just be best to raise taxes and give people free school. Then again in America that would probably be seen as the socialists taking over to force students into liberal indoctrination camps, so that idea won\\'t be happening any time soon.  Both kids in your example would recieve aid if you could file for fin aid independently. So neither would get screwed over there.  As for the chance of the kid double dipping. What about the person on disability or food stamps or some other government program that are under the age of 24? The government doesn\\'t know if their parents are still supporting them other than the kids word.   Why does it make sense that a 23 year old supporting themself since they were 18, file independently on taxes since they were 18, not allowed to file independently for financial aid. Because it could be abused? We let people abuse other welfare programs because of how few the numbers are and because it\\'s better make sure all who need help get it than leave some who need help to starve solely to prevent a few leeches.  The issue is partly that the government has a double standard of when they consider you an independent adult. Parents should either be legally required to pay their estimated contribution or the government should not take them as a factor in the fin aid decision at all.  At 18 you can be considered an independent adult in anyway but this and that\\'s ridiculous. My Accounting professor made it clear that these funds are drying up too. When they went through the UW-System, nearly 50% of total funding for the University of Wisconsin system came from the state government. When I was in the course, it was just over 21%. That\\'s not what dictatorship means. It\\'s a combination of predatory lending and shrinking state budgets for higher education. Not fun for many but the banks. I\\'ll also only respond to a few too, but I\\'d like to remark that many of my beliefs are flexible and it\\'s been enjoyable reading many of your points. With some of my points I play Devil\\'s Advocate just to pursue and assess multiple sides even if I don\\'t believe the rhetoric entirely myself.   While Driver\\'s Licenses/License plates are fees, they are nothing close to the direct cost of the road, much less requiring massive loans. Yet the cost-per-foot of the roads are quite high. Public use and benefit for them go to all, as well as the cost. But you can also say that it\\'s no more than the community impact of educated individuals creating new businesses, industries, and products that better the world.  Additionally, our point is the same about universities on money and their spending to attract students. Their highly-paid coaches and large stadiums are an example of their marketing department (people want to see Gator Football, for an example), and they want them to be the best to attract more students so they get more money to get better coaches, etc. I\\'m not saying that they do it so some Administrator makes a higher profit, though it definitely could have sounded that way. So there\\'s clarity. :)  I should add that there\\'s a second-factor to my rhetoric; I don\\'t believe that we need so many people going to school, and it\\'s been pushed much more heavily in recent decades. While I believe many people that would do great in school avoid it due to the debt burden, there are many people who simply go to college that will contribute to society with careers that don\\'t actually need a degree. Some don\\'t even want to go but feel they should. The government-dictated funding would provide a harder cap on how many students are allowed enrollment, pushing the standards for entry upward, meaning that a greater percentage of the students enrolled are likely those that would receive greater benefit.  Many industrialized nations offer education heavily subsidized or free compared to us. The common argument is that we\\'re a bigger country and couldn\\'t afford it. My reply is that because we\\'re a bigger country we should be able to afford it more easily because we allow greater specialization in our nation with more people and a more diverse economy.  Keep in mind that US Student Loan Debt as of June 2014 was 1.2 trillion. The Stimulus of 2008 (TARP) and the Bailout of 2008 (Emergency Economic Stabilization Act) were both around 700 billion dollars. For that cost we could have entirely wiped out all existing debt that covers many years\\' tuition and expenses at universities. The cost for 1 year of expenses at a university, if we budgeted, is laughable, especially considering that we\\'d drive the cost down if universities no longer had to market so aggressively and would thereby need less money to operate.  That is a really good point for a specific individual. Still, I can\\'t imagine that the people in that very specific situation PLUS the rich people who\\'ve been neglected (from my original comment) would benefit greater from OP\\'s solution than the lower-class kids that would benefit from the existing system.  As I tried to make clear before: A LOT of people are getting fucked either way; how can we most help the most people? The unfortunate reality behind the rise in tuition costs is not that public Universities are non-profit, but that public Universities are not profitable. Not obligated, but it\\'s just a deal where the whole society benefits from having more educated people. I was a double major declaring as independent, because I thought I was, and lost what funding I had because of it. Why? My parents together make about 50k but my dad has Heart failure and my mom has MS. They are both pretty expensive diseases but that\\'s not taken into account and at the time only my mom was on disability. But they don\\'t take that into account that my parents have very expensive conditions (Or it didn\\'t at the time)  Anyway, I was doing good in school and now I am a useless, fucked up waste of space with a bunch of debt who will never amount to anything. I said lecture.  In a flipped classroom the lecture is a video and discussion/homework is done with a teacher/group. Oh don\\'t get me wrong, I agree. I think that capitalism can work well if accompanied with several basic and essential socialist actions. The most important being education. Essentially, if people weren\\'t so stubborn about paying for the people they can\\'t physically see and/or are related to them, they\\'d see the overall quality of life would increase (perhaps imternationally even). At the very least they\\'d be able to not have to deal with as many \"stupid\" people (really more ignorant due to lack of education and exposure that college would bring them). And because America has so many resources, we have the potential to benefit the most. Well, more like we\\'re of the few who haven\\'t reaped these benefits.  What are public universities? I thought this discussion was about all colleges.  It sounds like you like Europe\\'s college system. Either way they have the money and state colleges (and I think most private) are nonprofit, so I don\\'t see why they don\\'t just pay. I understand holding some surplus, but C\\'mon they still have 10/11 of their budget. I can\\'t see any reason to refrain, except that they\\'re selfish.  If a society allowed people to achieve based on merit and not financial ability, then theoretically the society would improve with the increase of skilled professionals, and not a society of capable but untrained imdividuals doimg meager work. Yet america doesn\\'t adopt that system and yet leads in technological innovation.  You seem to misunderstand how that tends to work in practice. Your individual consent is not necessary for anything the government does. The consent for programs like that are given in aggregate when you pick one of the binary options at election time.  But don\\'t worry, the US Govt. is not subsidizing higher education anywhere near the level those European commies are. Don\\'t expect that to change soon either. > Well, um, what would stop parents who could support their children from simply not so that the government would step in and give then all this aid money that their parents could afford and would but now they don\\'t have to.   Good. Parents are under no obligation to pay for their children\\'s higher education funds. Instead it should be covered completely by public funds from tax payers dollars.  The cost relative to inflation has stayed the same, academically speaking. The people paying the price has changed. And when that \"market crash\" happens while the student is in school, good fucking luck. That\\'s exactly what happened to me and I was helpless. My parents were making about $160k iirc leading up to 2008 economic fuckery. My dad was laid off that September, called me and said \"I\\'m sorry, we can\\'t pay for school anymore for you, but we already made 1/3 tuition payment a couple weeks ago so you have a little time. You\\'ll need to get loans or pay yourself.\" At 18 years old I freaked the fuck out for a couple days and seriously considered dropping out, but my now-husband encouraged me to try to find a way to pay for school first.  Financial aid office told me to contact FAFSA about it, but FAFSA said I wasn\\'t eligible for anything based on my parents income and because I was not independent and to wait and see what happened when I filed next year. Not even subsidized loans! February 2009 my mom was laid off from her job and my dad was still out of work, surely that would be good enough for FAFSA to give me some aid. Nope! Because of my dad\\'s severance package, and the next year my mom\\'s severance package, FAFSA still said they made too much for me to qualify for anything. They said that every fucking year. I tried every possible avenue they offered to appeal it and have an exception made.  For fucks sake, my 2008 tax return I started claiming myself because I was legit covering half or more of my expenses for the year. If the IRS is cool with me being financially independent, why not FAFSA too? Are they not part of the same government?  Meanwhile, my parents drained their savings to take care of their other two dependents while I was 100% on my own. I think they even borrowed from their 401k to make sure the mortgage and bills were always paid. They did the math and eating $1 Whoppers on Wednesdays was cheaper than making their own burgers and buying vegetables. My dad couldn\\'t find a job for over a year despite plenty of experience and a masters degree in his field. My mom is still, almost 6 years later, unable to find work in her field. FAFSA was unwilling to see the reality of the situation and help me out. They counted severance AND unemployment compensation toward my parents\\' income when calculating their expected family contribution. They were barely getting by! But somehow still made too much. Essentially, FAFSA said they weren\\'t poor enough. To make matters worse... I appealed to my university for their in-house financial aid and they said the same thing, my parents make too much. Went to the state asking for help and they said the same.  I ended up taking unsubsidized FAFSA loans, and found a state scholarship for STEM degrees that I got, which covered 1/2 my tuition. (Fun fact: that scholarship turned into a loan the day I stopped working in the state, so I\\'m now paying that back too.) I paid for the other 1/2 of my tuition out of pocket working 20-30 hours per week. And my room/food/books were thankfully paid for by working as an RA. So while I absolutely recognize that I am lucky my loans aren\\'t ridiculous now that I\\'m done, it\\'s still more than it could have and should have been. I can\\'t even imagine students taking on double the debt I did just so they can sleep somewhere and eat every day. Or triple the debt so they can focus on school and not work so much. All because of financial factors that are completely out of their control. All because their family is not poor enough.  Where abouts are you from, just out of interest?  It\\'s just insane to see a European generalise all European countries into one blob, given that the education system in each country is different. In the UK, the hop from High School to a Sixth Form College is huge, and then the jump from College to University is just as big. And I have never met anyone who was saving up to go to a US University =\\\\ College costs a lot because of government interference.  You actively support tyranny of the majority and see nothing wrong with how that infringes upon the minority.  My best friend went through hell to file a FAFSA several years ago. She was living with my family and me at the time because her dad was not a nice person. She tried to get around it, but they insisted they needed it even though she had 0 support from him since before she graduated high school all because she was never legally emancipated. She also had to provide proof that her mom had passed years before. The whole thing is screwed up and definitely needs reformed. tuition at public universities has gone up because state level budget cuts have cut funding. . . First of all, the \"people in that very specific situation\" (presuming you mean my \"market crash\" group) *do* benefit now, that\\'s the point: I was trying to show is that because FAFSA doesn\\'t take into account historical earnings/assets, the historical support accorded to a \"spoiled\" kid whose parents won\\'t pay for college can\\'t be factored in.  Second, how would OP\\'s solution substantially disadvantage lower-class kids?  What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents.  This workaround doesn\\'t have to be *easy*, and you can force them to prove the lack of support.  This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member.  This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation.  Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn\\'t have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets.  (If there are a very small number of them extending help won\\'t affect what\\'s available to others; if there are a very large number of them they\\'re a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)  To some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed.  However, there\\'s a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren\\'t insignificant.  FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it\\'s a relatively small amount.  Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else\\'s dime), but in doing so they\\'d be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the *only* assistance their kid was getting.  My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won\\'t be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.  Is all of this more work for FAFSA?  Sure, but as you\\'ve mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.  Basically, I\\'m not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn\\'t be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students.  Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant. Seeing as how 60% of students start college taking high school level coursework, it stands to reason that college should be subsidized.   That and college ready math scores aren\\'t even above 10% in CA. I don\\'t know of any other states that measure, but I\\'m sure they\\'re around the same.  Not sure of all states, but generally a public university is one that received government funds, which places some restrictions on them as to who they have to accept/can\\'t deny. (Public universities have to be equal opportunity) That\\'s a good point, and I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t read thoroughly enough to find this part of the discussion! At the same time, this seems like an awfully narrow exemption of an already small group. The majority of students paying their own way through college still receive SOME financial aid from their parents (such as summer housing, occasional payments for food, etc), and there aren\\'t many who would oppose financial aid for the truly financially independent. When I was in school I had close friends that went through this process of showing complete financial independence from a parent or parents (basically had to show how the parent had already proven to be unsupportive and absentee). It wasn\\'t easy, but it was granted. Are there situations that you see that haven\\'t been covered that should be, and do you mind elaborating (or showing me where you\\'ve posted them)? I think OP was going for something more along the lines of: there are many things in the world that can be abused, but we don\\'t take them away just because of that potential. You could hurt someone with a fork but we still have those.  TIL Sweden, Norway, Finland etc are dictatorships. I\\'ve been in a very similar situation, so it\\'s a topic that\\'s gotten some previous thought on my end. >It is with grants and scholarships, which is what we\\'re talking about in the first place.  ...we\\'re talking about people who **Can\\'t** get grants due to their parents income. So that point is moot. Scholarships aren\\'t available to everyone (not every one and not even most are given them).  Education should not be available only to some people, it should available to everyone. I don\\'t care about supply and demand. Especially since this sub is about the fact that government has no problem paying for kids in other situations. Your comment is enlightening. You didn\\'t say how much the severance was, but unemployment is generally about half of earnings in the USA. That means your family probably still made much more during 2009 than the median household income. You say they were barely getting by even after they stopped paying for your tuition, but maybe you really mean that they were barely maintaining their previous lifestyle? It is a lot of money to hand out, however colleges and universities are severely over priced.  I know at the state level in my state they considered me an independent, but I had to jump through hoops to prove it. Basically I had to show I had been living on my own with no trips home longer than a week and that my parents hadn\\'t given me more than $700 in the past year. Also I had to show I had a job and made enough to support myself and my parents weren\\'t claiming me as a dependent. The dependent thing is crucial and most families would save more on taxes than the kid would get in financial aid, so I don\\'t think many people would be willing to do that.   I think a lot of kids were in similar situations as I was. My parents had just lost everything right as I was graduating high school and although they still had a high income, they were in the process of filing for bankruptcy. And of course the bankruptcy and the divorce took about 5 years to get through, so it never got taken into consideration.  That\\'s not true. A school like the University of Massachusetts is a public university, because it receives the core of it\\'s funding from a state appropriation, and in turn, is run not by a president and private board of trustees, but rather a state-appointed chancellor and trustees appointed by the governor. (Other states have regents, boards of governors, etc.) The state indirectly administers the school through its appointees, and the legislature has some say in school governance, including tuition. Meanwhile, a school like BU only receives grants, usually for specific items, and is funded by an endowment that derives much of its money from alumni donations (please note, I\\'m oversimplifying here). It is run by privately elected trustees and a president chosen by the trustees. Since it receives federal grants, it must abide by federal policies, including non-discrimination, but it\\'s not considered a public university. Actually, considering the number of legally-owned guns (and people who legally own guns) in the U.S., it\\'s shockingly *rare* how often you guys shoot each other compared to pretty much any other cause of death.  Guns are scary, sure, but not all that high on the statistical totem pole.  However, if you want an example that\\'s less conducive to snark, they might as well take cars away because people might crash into each other with them. Why are taxpayers obligated to pay for other people\\'s college?  > $1000 to $1500 a quarter isn\\'t practically free.  It is with grants and scholarships, which is what we\\'re talking about in the first place.  >Also many careers require a bachelors degree.  We\\'re not talking about career placement, we\\'re talking about education.   Of course better schools will get you better careers. And because of that, there are more applicants and thus higher tuition at those schools. It\\'s supply and demand. Community colleges aren\\'t practically free. $1000 to $1500 a quarter isn\\'t practically free.   Also many careers *require* a bachelors degree. Even if you spend the first two years at CC (like I did) to get an associates, you still have to spend another two years at least to get your bachelors.   I personally was able to pay for CC with a combination of my job, the schools payment plan, and the fact that I could still live at home. But I couldn\\'t go completely full time and it took me 3 years to get AS. Then I still had to transfer to get my BS and I would not have been able to do so if I hadn\\'t finally convinced my parents to take the parent plus loan out for me (that I will be paying back). Even doing CC and going to state school, I will be $40,000 in student/parent plus loan debt plus interest.  No, because private schools also exist. These colleges are public because they receive significant amounts of funding from public tax money. Taxes are voluntary in the sense that if you don\\'t wish to pay taxes you can always leave the country. And this is relevant to your mafia analogy. Yeah. I\\'d explained the circumstances but no one cared. Only my mom got disability at the time. Dad worked and made the 50k. But can no kobger . I am too old now. By the time I got around to grad school no one would be interested So it doesnt *cost* the state a penny. It would just *prevent* them from charging massive amounts of money for a \"public\" service. I agree with the first half of this statement. Except school shouldn\\'t be expensive.  There\\'s no reason for live lectures.  Every answer to any question can be recorded. Because it thrusts your child into debt regardless, just not as much while you\\'re taking advantage of the system. If you have the money to pay and are willing to submit the child into debt like that, the child needs the support anyhow as the parent is a terrible provider and likely wouldn\\'t accept it anyhow.  While this is off-topic, I think a much greater cause for concern in education is the massive increase in the cost of education, not the availability of the funds with which to receive one. It might not be as foolish a question as you think. It varies by state. For example, the Pennsylvania State University is not owned by PA in any way, shape, or form. It only receives ~10% of it\\'s budget from the state. The state has some seats on the board of trustees, but only limited influence over the school.  Yes, all public universities are owned by the state they are in. this is already done... problem is that everyone wants a university of <state> degree rather than the practically free community college ones  What are the written stipulations of this deal?   Where is your proof of consent for all parties involved? ',\n \">...so are you agreeing with me here?  Not exactly.  You claim that they add to the competitiveness of the game, when in reality, a restriction doesn't inherently add or take away anything.  >Yeah, and I see nothing wrong with this. Sometimes a player just gets lucky and it increases their chances a bit. It's not like Player A's chances of victory skyrocket to 100%. Player B has to assess their situation and act accordingly to avoid losing.  In a competitive environment, this is bad. In a casual environment it may be good. In a competitive environment, everyone wants the better player to win 100% of the time. However, if you're fine with letting the worse player win sometimes (Possibly rarely), as people in casual environments are, it's fine.  >Makes the game more exciting. Changes the odds in a game that still requires skill.  How does it make it more exciting? I don't understand.  Is it by making it unpredictable? In this case, would you like my proposed option (1 in 100 hits are twice as hard). It still requires skill, but as I said before, the player who plays better will not always win with an element of random chance.  >A mistake that was totally unanticipated by the other player. They got lucky. I suppose it's different in that it's not random luck generated by the computer, but it's still an element of luck.  Player A makes a mistake. How often you make mistakes is part of your overall skill. The person who makes mistakes less is a better player. I guess you could call it random for the other player, but it isn't outside of the player's control and knowledge (Which is usually how I define random chance) To the scrabble example, if highly skilled players could win much more reliably (say 60%, 70% of the time) if they got the only J, would it be a problem then? When it becomes less about the game and more about who gets the best letter, I think the game suffers. Scrabble works because the tiles are pretty well balanced (maybe s needs to be worth nothing on its own, its a really great tile). The harder to use letters are worth more points, so if you get high point or low point letters, you can win both ways. But in smash, many of the items don't feel balanced like this. I don't have new interesting strategies because my opponent got the ray gun. I sort of have to wait until he can't use it anymore. \",\n 'A+ trolling, for a n00b. > Similarly, it isn\\'t at all obvious that the phrase \"I could care less\" is an incorrect way of expressing apathy. Nobody seems to have any problem with the fact that \"I\\'ve been better\" generally means something like \"I\\'m not doing very well right now.  \"I couldn\\'t care less\" expresses apathy in the extreme: you\\'re saying that you care so little about x, that you couldn\\'t possible care less. Conversely, \"I could care less\" is a meaningless statement: it simply says that you care a certain amount about x. Theoretically, you could care 0 about everything, so saying that you care something about x is tautological.   \"I\\'ve been better\" is a slightly different example since it doesn\\'t use the hypothetical: it gives us the information that, compared to now, you have been better in the past, indicating that in the grand scheme of things, you are not as good as you\\'ve experienced.  I\\'ve been better suggests that this is not the best you\\'ve been, but also not the worst. That is what it means literally and how it is generally used.   I could care less implies that you don\\'t care the most but you don\\'t care the least. That you are essentially somewhere between caring a lot and not caring, but ultimately you care a little. However, as used commonly, most people mean I could not care less. Because the not suggests that this is the least amount they could care, which is what they are trying to convey.  Each and every year millions of people wrongly use the term \"I could care less\". The phrase \"I could care less\" has become a very common phrase used to express your lack of interest in an aforementioned topic. However, the phrase makes no sense. We, the people of the internet, must fix this!  Now, by using the phrase \"I could care less,\" the point you are trying to make is, on a scale of 0 - 10, that you care absolutely 0. However, if you could care less, you cannot be at 0 caring, as there must be a level below that to care less.  Now, the correct phrase to express 0 caring is \"I couldn\\'t care less.\" If you could not care less, then you are Absolute 0 Caring. You CAN NOT care less than you currently do. Absolute Zero Caring.  **Summary:**  I could care less : **WRONG**   I couldn\\'t care less: **RIGHT**  [Duty Calls...](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png) \"I could care less\" is not by a long shot the only expression where the literal meaning isn\\'t the understood meaning. I don\\'t see why people pick on it specifically. It\\'s way closer to its intended meaning than something like \"let the cat out of the bag\". This is the same argument as /u/airdog1992, who I agree with in this corner case, so heres ∆.  But I almost exclusively hear the term steep learning curve in reference to some activities\\' difficulty or complexity, not the rate it needs to be learned.  I think that the issue with \"I could care less\" as an expression of apathy is that apathy and empathy are dichotomous.  To say \"I could not care less\" is to have zero empathy, where as to say \"I could care less\" is to imply a small but non-zero amount of empathy.  Additionally it is generally used in a context, often a hyperbole, to express no empathy and when could is used rather than couldn\\'t it is a clear case of a verbal typo.  Health on the other hand has more of a continuum . ',\n 'Pretend you\\'re a potential investor. You walk through the offices to get a feel for the place. You look around at the programmers there. In one scenario, they all look like [Comic Book Guy.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/The_Simpsons-Jeff_Albertson.png) In another, they\\'re all well-groomed, professionally-dressed people. Which do you feel more confident in? Work for a company that primarily does government contracting. The software engineering culture in the public space is really different than in the private space. Because perceptions matter. If I know nothing about programming, then I am going to be likely to assess the risk of an investment largely on the basis of assessments that have little to nothing to do with programming. That\\'s human nature. Leaving your investors or potential investors with a bad impression is a great way to make sure they give money to your competitors and not you.   Now, this bit of human nature may not mean much to the folks in the cube, but it means a great deal to the people at C-level.  Have friends who do that.  They go in to work in shorts and a tshirt every day.  Like I said-  the real world doesn\\'t seem to care. Funny-  no single tech company has a dress code.  I\\'ve worked at HP, Amazon, Facebook, and several startups.  Never had one.  They all seem to work, make large amounts of money.  All 3 startups sold for 5-20x the investor\\'s capital.  The real world doesn\\'t agree with you. It is called \"investor confidence\". When investors come in to a business for the first time to scope things out they will feel more comfortable if the employees appear professional and not aloof. It shows that the management has control of their employees and people aren\\'t freewheeling around. Structure = stability, while chaos = instability. There is nothing wrong with people expecting people that they are paying to present themselves in a way that shows that the business is a professional environment, in fact, if you care to look there are multiple studies on how a person dressing professionally improves their work ethic and self esteem. Both of which, I am sure, are great for business. I wore a stained Einstein t-shirt and shorts the other day.  The day before that it was a t-shirt that just said \"No, I will not fix your computer.\"  None of these places had any dress code at all.  Nor did any of the startups I worked for, which are definitely small companies (5-30 people).  I suggest you check out west coast engineering culture-  someone in polo shirt and khakis is considered dressed up here.  Usually its a sign that they\\'re interviewing elsewhere or have a date after work. On the east coast? The software companies I\\'ve worked at (during undergrad) all had khakis and polo shirts as minimum dress code and this seemed to be common at other places I interviewed. And a West coast startup has a different culture, different employees, and different investors than many other businesses. Just because something works there doesn\\'t mean that it works universally.  Human beings always make superficial judgments based on subjective cultural criteria. That\\'s how our brains work. That people don\\'t like basic human psychology because such processes offend some sensibility or another does not change the way people are.   >Not to mention the fact that while industry leaders can largely get away with whatever they want, other companies may not have the same latitude for casualness.   That would imply that the whole \"perception\" thing is completely arbitrary, no? ',\n 'I never said that non-employable skills are not important or useful, I said that the public should not be forced to pay for those skills since it will not see any real return on investment.  That belief does not at all contradict the validity of universities, they are necessary to teach important things that cannot/are not covered in lower levels of education. Such as the various engineering disciplines, medicine, accounting, economics and so forth.  Contrary to your statement, research institutions can be the most beneficial is this regard as they attract talented people and cutting edge technology. These things provide educational benefits to students studying at these locations, they can also allow them more exposure to people working in their fields. It will benefit them, again in ways that aren\\'t measured in dollars.  Your tl;dr is a straw man if my position. Artists, philosophers, and historians don\\'t always ply their trade for benefit to the coffers of the public. There is also the human condition and their work what makes it worth living > all I\\'m asking is that universities find people willing to hire graduates,   Most public universities (at least the ones I have experience with) have employment programs that let employers advertise positions directly to students and graduates.  I responded to another comment below with some similar rhetoric, but the reason that universities have such breadth requirements and such is because universities were created with the purpose of creating an educated populace. Therefore, breadth requirements. A university\\'s goal is not inherently jobs and job qualifications (though they do train you for that).   Jobs and job qualifications, however, ARE the goals of technical schools, where, if I\\'m not wrong, the load is lightened in terms of breadth. Not sure if the bar is raised, but that\\'s something you\\'ll have to take up with technical schools if they\\'re not.  >Simply put, those students shouldn\\'t receive government funding. It\\'s pretty clear who they are before enrollment too.  Is it? When every applicant suddenly turns up and says \"my goal is X job/career/industry\" because of these rules then it suddenly becomes impossible to distinguish. It\\'s not hard to lie about aspirations and ambition.  > You seem to be missing the situations in which students receive financial assistance from the government and then become gainfully employed. These students represent a significant return on investment. The addition of educated citizen and consumer represents a benefit to the community as well as an increased tax revenues for the government.  I agree, which is why I didn\\'t say that government should stop funding university entirely, but rather target their funding at those types of students.  >What of students who - having used financial assistance to graduate then fail to find a job? There are plenty of student\\'s whose goals are not employment. Some go for the social bonds developed there, or to enable them to find a better marital partner, or to further goals other than simply finding a career. Would you burden universities by tying their successful graduates with a narrow set of restrictive employment options?  Simply put, those students shouldn\\'t receive government funding. It\\'s pretty clear who they are before enrollment too. Also, all I\\'m asking is that universities find people willing to hire graduates, not that the grads necessarily need to accept the job offers.  >If the university\\'s granting of a degree to an individual creates an obligation beyond the scope of academia, why not extend it to child rearing, or nutrition, or other desirable goals.   Because no one goes to university with these goals in mind. \"Wasting\" is a strong word with strong connotations.  The purpose of a university is to produce an educated populace. The purpose of a university is NOT (inherently) to provide jobs or job qualifications. That is the purpose of technical schools. Or would you disagree?  Assuming the above, then students receiving government funding are essentially being told by the government \"This money is to help you become an educated human being in our society.\" Would you believe that someone who graduates from a university has achieved that goal? If so, doesn\\'t accomplishing the goal mean the money was not wasted?  Yes, it might be true that society MIGHT (and I say might because I\\'m not sure about the figures on it, and I think there\\'s a chance that the current system might break even) not be seeing a MONETARY return on investment. However, the populace today is overall much more educated than it has ever been. Is that not a return on investment on its own?  The idea that the only things worth funding must be measured in terms of what you get back in dollars is laughable to me.  Not OP, but because they will not foreseeable pay back the taxpayers who put them through school.  Students who go to a university, on the public dime, without the intent of developing/improving useful, employable skills are simply wasting other people\\'s hard earned tax money. I think that is wrong. The only things worth PUBLIC funding. Why should the tax payers be forced to pay for something that will not benefit them?  If a person wants to use college as an extremely expensive personal development program, let them use their own money.  TLDR: The fact that you think the public exists as a wallet for the existential whims of special snowflakes is laughable to me.

But what they really mean to say is, there aren\\'t enough americans to work for the salaries they want to pay them.  I don\\'t think this is true; the high tech non-poaching thing was an effort to keep wages low, but it existed precisely because there wasn\\'t enough skilled labor to go around.   If you double software engineer salaries, it doesn\\'t magically create a whole bunch of new, highly skilled engineers; the companies are fighting over the same limited number of software engineers, and they wanted to avoid going into a bidding war.  I basically agree with what /u/zippityhooha said, but looking over your comment, it seems that you\\'re basically advocating for completely open and free immigration.  (You use words like \"pragmatic\" and are saying basically that the labor market in the US dictated an inflow of illegal immigrants a decade ago and currently, that inflow is declining because the labor market is now different.)  I\\'m not here to argue whether an open and free immigration policy is better or not, but am here to ask whether you think you can really change OP\\'s mind with your arguments, which are based on pragmatism, while OP is based on who \"deserves\" citizenship. This is a discussion thread, if you disagree with something then explain why.  A one-word snarky comment is unlikely to get you anything besides downvotes and eyerolls. If you can provide sources for the declining rate of illegal immigration and the solutions with the fines, that\\'d be nice.   I\\'m awarding a ∆ despite having fervently argued the opposite side, because I like the proposed combination and will agree to it. If they fulfill a needed role, and can prove that and continuous residency, and are willing and able to pay the fee (perhaps even in installments or something if needed), I see no reason not to give permanent residency and a path to citizenship.   Thanks for the well reasoned comment! I recognize OP\\'s claim was based in who \"deserves\" citizenship, but I think the context of the problem and the proposed solutions are often lost in the discussion... so yeah, I think that can change OP\\'s mind some.  Also, I alluded to it a little bit in my last paragraph - but the US (or any country) is free to allow or reject immigrants into the country (or grant amnesty) on whatever basis it choses.  It seems that OP is of Filipino descent and his parents did the paperwork.  I could argue as a devils advocate that impoverished Mexicans both share more culture/history/ties with the US & overcame more adversity than OP - and are therefore more \"deserving\" than he.    The point being that I\\'m not sure anyone is qualified or in the position to make the moral judgement of who \"deserves\" it more, and that therefore the only way to approach it is to simply pragmatically consider what\\'s best for the nation. Welfare isn\\'t about fairness. It is the acknowledgement that if we do not help the poor and unemployed buy food and shelter then we will pay just as much or more locking them up after they steal or engage in illegal activities to pay the bills. Personally I\\'d rather pay to educate someone because education is an investment with limitless potential. Prison is a dead end.  And before you tell me that we shouldn\\'t be giving money to people who are too lazy to work or to those willing to engage in a life of crime, I\\'d like to hear your suggestion on what to do with the people on welfare. Kicking people off welfare and letting them fend for themselves would be catastrophic to our economy and way of life. I can support welfare programs without also endorsing laziness. I don\\'t like lazy people, but I hate anarchy even more. Unfortunately there are no great options.   >There used to be lots of charities and mutual aid societies before the government edged them out.  Do you have a source on that?

EDIT: It seems like that was exactly the point I was trying to make. I would think that there is a certain amount of tragedy that can occur on a field that would distress the audience enough to consider removing themselves from the stadium or as a fan of the sport in general. But I guess if the roman spectators could handle watching people get slaughtered, some members of an audience will put up with just about any injury. The point being that the mass public doesn't really care about if the player gets hurt, they're there for the show, for their team. My favorite QB might snap his leg, but it's not gonna ruin my experience watching a football game, and I'm certainly not gonna leave the stadium because of it. This is true for 99.9999% of the public.    But it sure doesn't stop them from watching it. Sorry for the confusion. I issued my reply to stevegcook. You can see it there if you'd like.

Do soccer/football stadiums clear out when an injury occurs? \",\n 'Well, we could get all philosophical about this and say that *all* actions lead to harm by some convoluted trail of events, but we should really be reasonable and stick to direct or very close to direct events causing harm (e.g.: polluting a shared resource for personal gain, or something like that). There\\'s no point in debating if we\\'re going to get rendered down to semantics here. I wasn\\'t addressing whether or not they should be legalized, but why it\\'s in society\\'s interest to discourage drug use. Well you have a 50% chance of dying from a smoking-related illness if you smoke cigarettes, and lots of people (far more people than use heroin, cocaine, and meth combined) still use those. 25% is high but it still remains that you are far more likely (75% likely) to _not_ become an addict. Maybe what I\\'m taking issue with is more your phrasing, which sounded like, \\'If you do heroin, you are likely to become a junkie.\\' That isn\\'t true. It\\'s cartoonish because you\\'re taking the less likely outcome and making it sound like the most likely, and more than that focusing specifically on the worst case scenario of the non-functioing, stealing, OD-ing junkie within that less-likely outcome. 1 in 4 is an extremely good chance. Also that study only covers people who have tried it at least *once* in their lives... Its not like people are able to regularly use heroin and only 25% of them get hooked.  Basically each time you do heroin, it increases your chances of becoming hooked.  I would be willing to wager that the 75% who never became addicted were only using once or twice in their entire life.  I know there is a tendency to exaggerate the addictive nature of a lot of drugs, but heroin isn\\'t one of them.  Sure but someone saying, \"if you do heroin, there\\'s a good chance you\\'re going to become a junkie and mug people\" is a very disingenuous exaggeration. The odds are not good, they\\'re one in four. Sort of ironic that OP is talking about the harms of stigmas and taboos, and the top answer reinforces exactly the cartoonish perception that stigmatizes heroin use so much. You\\'re right about the alcohol, which is why we ban *drunk driving*, not drinking itself. Similarly we ban driving under *any* intoxicant or *any* intoxicated state. Being sleepy isn\\'t illegal, but driving sleepy *is*. Getting drunk isn\\'t, but beating your wife while drunk *is.* That\\'s the distinction. I would argue people should not be driving or operating heavy machinery if they are impaired in any way at all, and I would suggest that being under the effects of *withdrawal* does not constitute proper sobriety.  Drugs may predispose towards certain behaviours (and they do), like sitting around while high on pot, fighting while drunk, or being a loud asshole while on cocaine, but, again, this is not reason enough to ban the drug. We expect people to behave appropriately in society and not break the \"big\" laws (i.e.: cause harm to others), and if they are unable to do so they should be encouraged to stop by their friends, family, or whatever. It is not the role of the state to prevent activities which \"predispose\" towards certain behaviours as there is no certainty that a crime will be committed. People being able to enjoy their lives should take precedence. I can tell you 100% that all drugs should be legalized immediately, everything. The science on this is rock solid and beyond question. Particularly in the case of hard drugs abuse, these people always, always have some sort of history of extreme abuse or neglect in their lives. Their brains become wired specifically toward their drug of choice, opiates, amphetamines or both. A huge part of what keeps them down is the feeling of being social outcasts - feeling unable to integrate back into society, it\\'s easier to turn back to addiction. In situations where they are treated with dignity, given access to health services. Even giving them access to free, clean drugs ends the cycle faster and more cheaply because they aren\\'t exposing themselves to nearly as many risks like sexual abusing themselves, criminal behavior and the risk of OD. Experiments have been done and these things have been a resounding success.  What\\'s really happening is that the state is actually preying on these people. The vast state apparatus is proof of this, police, legal system, prisons. The corruption surrounding these entities is enormously powerful.  Yes, and that difference is consequences.  If you shoot up because you had a long day at work, pass out on your side, and wake up to do it again the next day, then you are probably not an addict.  If you lost your job because you were stoned, sold all your stuff for money, spent all your money on drugs, can\\'t pay your bills, and still want to shoot up, you are addicted.  If you ever think, \"I want to quit but can\\'t,\" you are an addict. That study doesn\\'t contradict anything I\\'m saying.  > all these statistics seem to point to Heroin being really addictive... Of all the drugs, I\\'m not sure why you would even try to defend heroin  Let\\'s put it in the context of [other drugs](http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&page=95) then. 23% of heroin users become dependent, 32% of tobacco users, 15% of alcohol users, 18% of cocaine users... the rates are pretty similar, smoking tobacco has just as high a mortality rate and can directly kill the people around you, alcohol is worse for your bodily health and also contributes to tens of thousands of cases of accidental injury/death, rape, and domestic violence every year.... But by popular belief, _heroin_ is the worst of the lot, nothing else even comes close.  Maybe you think overstating the risk is ok because it deters people from using it, how could that be a bad thing? I think that can be very bad. I think there is value in people understanding the true breadth and magnitude of the problem, both so that they can make informed decisions for themselves and for others. I think it\\'s bad that people are so afraid of heroin that they won\\'t even consider policies that could be construed as \\'soft\\'. Decriminalized use, prescription heroin for addicts, syringe exchanges in many states, those options (though they have been shown to be effective at reducing the harms of abuse) are completely off the table because people are so afraid of it. I don\\'t think that is helpful to users or to society. I\\'m making a rational argument here and you\\'re accusing me of \"soapboxing?\" You\\'re bringing *strawberries* into a debate about hard drugs here, I think you\\'re derailing things a little.  Where did I claim \"abundant evidence\" without citing sources? You can look at [drug policy in Portugal](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal#Observations), which decriminalized *all* drugs in 2001, for evidence as to what the effects are of loosening drug laws. The Netherlands provides [heroin for free to addicts](https://news.vice.com/article/only-in-the-netherlands-do-addicts-complain-about-free-government-heroin) and it has had a massive public health benefit. Again, nothing is perfect, but we\\'re not trying to make society perfect here, simply improve the lives of our citizens.  Frankly, I think your aggression is unwarranted, and you haven\\'t contributed to the debate. I get the feeling I\\'m getting a bit of animosity here because I\\'m debating someone with \"81 deltas\". Society is a construct. Where do you get this idea that it even really exists and has some sort of narrative? Where do you get the idea that it ought to push it\\'s narrative? Of course no-one wants harm to come to other people but seriously, you\\'re just propping up this top down power structure that dictates to people what is right and wrong. Where does that assumption even come from? Why not my assumption that people do well when left alone? If we have a conscience why aren\\'t we free to use them?  Haha, okay, you got me, that\\'s a good point. :) But still, we don\\'t ban alcohol because of drunk driving! Similarly, I see no reason to ban other drugs because they also get you intoxicated, and especially considering the intoxication from some of them is benign. > This argument could be used to justify anything being legal so long as it had no absolutely direct harm to another human being.  With the caveat of \"no direct or *indirect*\" harm to another human being, I actually have no problem with this statement at all. I believe you should be able to do absolutely anything you want in the world as long as you do not harm others. Is this really a bad statement? Hey, I think your view is mostly right but I want to touch on the drug part, which I think is also mostly right. Still, if you dont do anything but get high, even without directly harming anyone else, its a problem; we\\'re all living in this community/country/world together and if you\\'re  taking up resources and not contributing then your harming the rest. People dont have a right to expect a person not do drugs and get high all the time without contributing, the same way that person doesnt have a right to accept all the beneficits of society w/o making a contribution.   Like I said, I mostly agree with you. The drug point probably needs some caveats though. No direct harm to others =/= no harm to others I don\\'t think you know what arbitrary means. Strawberries also have carcinogens in them but we don\\'t ban them because they aren\\'t as bad for you. Anyone who tries to deny the difference in effects between heroin and beer is deluding themselves.  Your high-and-mighty stance on garnteller looking down on the poor like a big bad upper-class jerk is also a giveaway you\\'re soapboxing. I\\'m glad you know about the abundant evidence without citing it too, great job.   When we\\'re talking about stakes this large, 1 in 4 is pretty damn high.  If  I had a 1 in 4 chance of winning the lottery and changing my life forever, you can be sure I\\'d be buying a ticket right away.   Ok, I accept your viewpoint, but you are actually reading the source wrong. The 2% number on the left is a portion of the total population and the number on the right is a percentage _of that 2%_. If the number of users went up from say 2% to 3% of the population, the _absolute number_ of heroin-dependent users would go up - 23% of a bigger number is obviously more than 23% of a smaller number - but the rate would stay the same at 23%. Only 2% trying it doesn\\'t make the 23% \\'more powerful.\\' If anything, it does the opposite...  > If heroin was as socially accepted as cigarettes and alcohol, the percentage would go up.  If the number of heroin users changed so drastically that it included a significant portion of the population, the rate of dependency might change somewhat - but we would expect it to go down, not up. The reason is this: heroin is currently socially unacceptable and a very uncommon drug. The 2% who are doing it now _despite those social stigmas_ are probably more risk-taking, impulsive, antisocial, less health-conscious, etc than the average person. People with these traits are more likely to become dependent, so they bring the dependency rate up. That rate of dependency is basically selecting for people who are more likely to become drug-dependent than the average person.  Conversely, almost everyone has used alcohol. So the population of alcohol users not only includes the same types of anti-social risk-takers that use heroin, but also people with average and above average risk-aversion and impulse control. These people are less likely to become dependent so they bring the overall dependency rate of alcohol down -they compensate for the high-risk people. I mean that each time you do heroin, you get closer to getting addicted.    I suppose its possible to use heroin regularly (like alcohol) and not really be addicted, but given most statistics and nearly every heroin experience I have ever seen... It doesn\\'t seem likely. >  Also that study only covers people who have tried it at least once in their lives... Its not like people are able to regularly use heroin and only 25% of them get hooked.  What do you mean by that? Aren\\'t the people who regularly use heroin seen as addicted? is there a line between an addict who uses heroin regularly or a non-addict who uses heroin regularly? Everyone else seemed to understand that \"good chance\" meant a significant chance, not more likely than not.  If I could enter a lottery for $1 with a 1 in 100 chance of winning $1000, everyone would agree that I have a \"good chance\" of winning.  This is common usage. 1 in every 4 still seems high enough that I wouldn\\'t want too many people doing it.  Actually, let\\'s just take heroin for an example of a \"dangerous\" addictive drug. Is it really the drug that is causing the problem, or is it the person\\'s behaviour? It\\'s clearly the latter, since the drug is just a powder extracted from a plant, it\\'s not inherently problematic. It\\'s *connected* to problems, but that\\'s not to say it directly causes them. Is addiction the culprit? Not necessarily, as being addicted to something doesn\\'t harm anyone but the addict, and only when the addict chooses to perform antisocial actions to feed their addiction. Addiction is not even a socially devastating event in any case; plenty of cigarette smokers attest to the prevalence of benign addiction in our society. If heroin were not illegal it would cost pennies to feed a habit, meaning an addict would not have to rob or steal. If the argument is then that the intoxication leads to antisocial activities keep in mind that, again, we have plenty of intoxicating activities in our society (alcohol is the big one) and the moral fabric has not degraded to a point where we have been ruined by it. We are adults and we can choose appropriate times and places for intoxication. We forbid intoxication when it can be societally dangerous (driving, operating machines) and morally abhor it when we feel it is inappropriate (around children, etc).  There is no rational reason for us to condone some drugs and forbid others, only moral habit, ingrained by culture. Some people in the world have a greater propensity for self-destruction than others, and these people often turn to drugs to escape life and hurt themselves. This is up to them, as they are adults and they can do as they choose. It is a moral evasion for society to blame drugs for the problem and not the user, as it allows us to blame an externality for our problems rather than human nature, which is tantamount to avoiding taking responsibility for our own actions. If most people were told that drinking Coke once a day would lead to a one in four chance of getting cancer, no one would drink coke.  A 25% change of getting hooked is extremely high (and actually are higher than I expected).  Cartoonish?  You\\'ve gotta be kidding me. I don\\'t know that most people did understand; I don\\'t mean to attack or infer about you personally but in my experience both on Reddit and in real life (even with people who should know better, such as physicians), most people have a very exaggerated perception of heroin - thinking that it\\'s addicting after the first time, or that 90% of people who use it die from it, or that heroin users are criminal junkies, or what have you. Your description implicitly reinforced those stereotypes, and I think that contributes to the harmful stigmas that are the subject of this thread.   Both times in the past that I have brought up the 25% figure on Reddit in the past, people have been very, very surprised and even disbelieving of it because it is so much lower than what they would have assumed. If we\\'re going to talk about a subject that most people have misperceptions about, I think full objective disclosure and not playing into stereotypes is important. I am commenting about the numbers that vote squinty posted above. It says 1 in 4 become addicted. They are saying that isn\\'t significant. I think most people would say that is significant.  EDIT: http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin  That was the original source that voted_quimby was quoting.  They are pointing to those numbers and saying that heroin is not very addictive because only 1 in 4 becomes addictive. My argument is that 1 in 4 is extremely addictive, especially when you take into consideration that this number is based on anyone who has ever tried heroin, *even once.*  From personal experience, it is definitely possible to only do heroin once, but if you go back to do it a second and third time, I feel your chances to get hooked grow exponentially higher.  Personally I have never met anyone who can just do heroin every once in a while like alcohol or cocaine.  In my personal experience, it is definitely a more habit forming drug and most of the statistics seem to back that up.  I didn\\'t realize there was so much confusion about this. > Drugs  This part is interesting because of the description of the complex nature of the situation. In the case of crimes resulting from drugs, I mentioned below that I believe the crime itself should be the primary offence, and the drug use which facilitated it would be a secondary offence that get tagged onto crimes. This would punish those who go crazy from drugs, without inherently punishing anyone for possession or use who has otherwise done nothing wrong. As to the rest, I understand the nature of the complex situation, but I\\'m not convinced that most people really think of it logically to that extent, nor that it is a problem helped by pushing it into the dark and more obscure recesses of society. Imagine momentarily a society where these kinds of drugs were legal and regulated the same way as a prescription or over the counter medication. Safe pre-made doses, regulated by bodies who can test that companies are making them to be as clean as possible, not something people have to do secretively in a dark alley trying to make sure they don\\'t get caught. I think part of the open use would be a more constructive conversation about the potential for abuse, and a reduction in drug related crimes and deaths. When we had high school drug intervention speeches, the officers came in with posters of dead kids and stories... almost all of them ended with \"his friend saw him passed out, got scared about someone finding out, and ran away leaving him to die without medical attention\". If there wasn\\'t the fear of punishment for using the drugs, I think a lot of these lives senselessly lost could have been saved. Beyond that... I can see what you\\'re saying about the issues with family and state, and the complex situations that could arise... but I think the current stigma of \"just trying to get high is wrong\" marginalizes and generalized a much more complex issue without leaving open a discussion for the complexity that surrounds it.   > Incest  The big point you made was about children with parents, and about family matters. As for births, recessive genes isn\\'t a great argument since we don\\'t live in a eugenic society. People have disabled kids all the time, no one is legally stopping them. As for children with parents, I made the point below that it should be a discussion of people of consenting age... not that some mother was manipulating their 6 year old to pleasure them. Paedophilia is a separate debate, and something of a grey area beyond about age 14 or 15, but of course the power struggle is a concern, and I recognize that point. My argument was for 2 people above the legal age, however. As for a family dispute as a result... I think this is an issue even in normal relationships. Mother\\'s getting attached to girlfriends and trying to get them married, the fallout afterwards... same goes for friendship circles when 2 friends date. This is an issue of openness, discussion, and the maturity of the social group. If 2 people date and then break up and it causes some kind of dilemma, that\\'s an issue with the people not inherently the act itself.  Right, guns don\\'t kill people, people kill people.  But it\\'s a hell of a lot easier to kill people with an Uzi than a spoon.  It\\'s also a hell of a lot easier to become a drain on society with cheap and abundant heroin than without it.  >There is no rational reason for us to condone some drugs and forbid others, only moral habit, ingrained by culture.   Of course there is.  How about \"based on the amount of harm they can cause\" as a rational reason?  It works for deciding which weapons we ban, after all.  I\\'m also not sure where you\\'re getting \"it is a moral evasion for society to blame drugs for the problem and not the user\" - the whole point of the post is about society deciding that behaviors such as shooting heroin are immoral. >Imagine momentarily a society where these kinds of drugs were legal and regulated the same way as a prescription or over the counter medication.  We don\\'t have to imagine.  We can look at *our* society, where opiates are tightly controlled, yet we regularly read about people who got put on oxycontin for pain, became addicted, and their life goes to hell.  These are people who aren\\'t doing it for a high, just to function.    Imagine if we increased the number of people that it was available to a thousand-fold, including people who don\\'t think through the consequences of addiction.  The can\\'t be a good thing.  Societal disapproval is the only tool beyond laws to prevent behavior harmful to society - and can be more effective than laws.  >Incest  No, we don\\'t stop people from having disabled children, but we don\\'t want to encourage situations that increase the incidence either.  Because once again, society pays to help take care of the children.  As for age of consent, there will ALWAYS been a power disparity.  A 20 year old can\\'t have a healthy, equal relationship with their 50 year old parent.  A parental relationship continues, regardless of age.  As for the friend group, friends change over your life.  Family doesn\\'t.  It\\'s the most basic social group.  Tearing it apart has more impact than a friend group fragmenting. > The point is that deciding what drugs to ban is arbitrary.  Damn near everything we do in society is arbitrary. We arbitrarily decided that our choice of government would be a liberal democratic republic for example. We had other choices, but that is the one that won out. Now it did so for a host of historical contextual reasons, but it wasn\\'t the only available choice nor was it in some way objectively best. It was just what was popular. That\\'s the definition of arbitrary.   And if it wasn\\'t for that arbitrary choice, then the option to even discuss what drugs we would like banned and which we would not want banned wouldn\\'t be open to discussion. But the point is, just because something is an arbitrary decision doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a random decision or that it is a bad decision. It just means that other lines of reasoning would lead to other equally valid choices. Arbitrary is \\'decided by one\\'s liking, dependent upon will or pleasure; at the discretion or option of any one\\' (OED).  But simply because a choice is subjective (arbitrary) doesn\\'t make it illogical.   Arbitrary choices can and are still logically supported.  At issue for reasonableness and logic in arbitrary choices is the question of if you shared the starting assumptions of those making the choice, would the choice made be a logically consistent outcome.   If the question is the OP\\'s point about the reasonableness of moral injunctions, then the question of the arbitrariness of the choices made is really not addressing the question in any meaningful way.   >As for age of consent, there will ALWAYS been a power disparity.  A 20 year old can\\'t have a healthy, equal relationship with their 50 year old parent.  Why not? Evidence? I should probably use a throwaway for this but whatever, I\\'ll say it: while I am not specifically attracted to my father, I am not repulsed by the idea. Were he my \"type\" and not romantically involved with my mother (and further, were he gay) I see no reason why I would necessarily be in an \"unhealthy\" relationship with him just because he is my father. It just doesn\\'t add up. The \"power dynamic\" is A) not necessarily going to exist in the sexual/romantic relationship, B) necessarily *bad* or unhealthy, nor C) absent from non-incestuous relationships. 1) There are a bevy of indirect harms in this case so the argument has no place.  2) Otherwise it could make sense, you can read JSM if you like, he is germane on that. > But if you\\'re shooting heroin, there\\'s a good chance you\\'ll become hooked.  I get what you\\'re saying but this a common misconception that I hate seeing repeated again and again. According to government stats less than a quarter of all heroin users ever become dependent on it. It has a high rate of dependency compared to other drugs, but the vast majority of users never become dependent - even if you assume that that figure is a conservative estimate.  [Source](http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin) > I would be willing to wager that the 75% who never became addicted were only using once or twice in their entire life.  Na, I don\\'t think so. That particular study didn\\'t look into it but it does refer to other survey data which only included drug users who used heroin at least 6 times. They did this to exclude experimental users. This survey showed that:  \"an estimated 71.2 percent of the daily heroin users reported having felt dependent on heroin. By comparison, an estimated 8.9 percent of the never daily users reported having had feelings of dependence on heroin. This difference in percentages from about 9 to 71 percent is consistent with presumed toxicity of nondaily heroin use versus daily heroin use.\" [Source] (http://ww1.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/92.pdf)  Basically, the people who used heroin every day had a high likelihood of feeling dependent, yes. Everyone else who used heroin less-than-daily but on 6 or more occasions had a very low likelihood of feeling dependent - so that 75% from before isn\\'t just one or two-time users. Yes it\\'s self-reported and subjective but it\\'s the best data I could find. I don\\'t care about deltas, but there are many many chemicals which are carcinogenic and you seem to think that the fact that alcohol and heroin both having some makes them more or less the same. Toothpaste and many things you encounter throughout the day have carcinogens so their mere presence is irrelevant.   I understand what Portugal did, but the United States isn\\'t Portugal, and assuming everything will be parallel is foolish.   My aggression is brought on by the use of words that have no place in your sentences and are used simply to mislead a given reader. Empty rhetoric used as some kind of placeholder for a compelling argument.  \"Plenty of things we do in life are dangerous. And we don\\'t prohibit them because we\\'re grown adults and we can do what we want,\" is exactly what I mean. This argument could be used to justify anything being legal so long as it had no absolutely direct harm to another human being, but we know that makes no sense, so we dismiss it as a reasonable argument.   Putting quotation marks around \"dangerous\" when referring to heroin is as callous as it is insulting. Have you ever met a heroin addict? Your writing makes it seem like it is as harmless as getting addicted to candycrush. Not to mention how you follow that up with a complete dissociation of cause and effect. \"Oh this person is doing hard drugs, well their actions are still there own and in no way affected by anything else! Yay, no causality!\"   An amalgamation of so many weird and illogical statements is not only unconvincing but just unpleasant to read.   Hey, I mean whatever.  I know people who have used heroin and not become hopelessly addicted.  Its definitely possible, but all these statistics seem to point to Heroin being really addictive, which is pretty much in line with everything I have seen from personal experience.  I feel like you are splitting hairs. Heroin is addictive and its really shitty for your body. Do people paint it to be cartoonishly and unjustly evil? I don\\'t think so.  I would say the reason people paint it in such a bad light is because once you are addicted, its an extremely ugly and painful process to get off of it.  Of all the drugs, I\\'m not sure why you would even try to defend heroin. I personally have never heard a good heroin story or seen a statistic that made me think heroin was being unjustly vilified by popular opinion. If you want to start your own society, go for it.  That\\'s what I was talking about in my Montana reference - if you are literally off on your own, not interacting with others, feel free to grow and use whatever drugs you want.    But in the context of the current society, we\\'ve made decisions like \"if the parents aren\\'t capable of providing adequate (as defined by society) care for their children, we, society, will step in and care for them at our own expense\".  In that case, your choices are no longer just impacting you.  As for your conscience?  If it doesn\\'t bug you to cut in line, then it\\'s ok to do so?  In general, even though it\\'s best for you, personally, it\\'s the disapproval of others (in a queuing culture) that keeps you from being a dick, even if you don\\'t see it that way. >But if you\\'re shooting heroin, there\\'s a good chance you\\'ll become hooked.  This is not how addiction works, we have good science to prove it. You\\'re simply caught up in this war on drugs propaganda but you\\'re struggling to accept it. This entity called \"society\" at large that you believe is shaping values is not real. This is propaganda 101. Society is being lead into these values by mouth pieces who make decisions for us.   We don\\'t exist just be facsimiles. It\\'s not how any of this is supposed to work. The social stigma you fear is an illusion.  Saying that not everyone who does something becomes hooked doesn\\'t make it good to do. If you said only 1/4 of people who drive drunk kill anyone so therefore its not a huge deal, that would be pretty bad logic. The point is that deciding what drugs to ban is arbitrary. Alcohol is [carcinogenic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens), habit forming, causes antisocial behaviour, and can cause lethal withdrawal. [By some measures *heroin is safer than alcohol.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse#mediaviewer/File:HarmCausedByDrugsTable.svg) Yet people aren\\'t out in the streets demanding alcohol prohibition (anymore). Indeed, its prohibition was a complete disaster. So there is clearly a disconnect here if we are looking at prohibiting some drugs based purely on objective data.  The thing is, *plenty of things we do in life are dangerous.* And we don\\'t prohibit them because we\\'re grown adults and we can do what we want. Belief in personal freedom is a huge component of Western morality, yet we maintain drug prohibition when there is objective evidence that not only does it not work but also that it exacerbates the problems we have with illegal drugs rather than mitigating them.  I agree with the OP, the only reason people object (mostly) to hard drug use is cultural conditioning. There is no rational reason. Legalize it, make it cheap and safe, and stop ostracizing the poor and vulnerable subset of society that chooses to do these things to excess.  One edit:   > It\\'s also a hell of a lot easier to become a drain on society with cheap and abundant heroin than without it.  Heroin is already abundant. It\\'s just not cheap. Reducing its cost to pennies a dose (or even providing it free) would turn a huge portion of our underclass from poor, antisocial, self-destructive fringe dwellers into simply self-destructive fringe dwellers. If you still want to look down on them morally for their choices that\\'s up to you. You are not reading that study correctly.  Or rather you are also ignoring the percentage of people who tried it in the first place.  Notice that only 2% of the people interviewed for that study tried Heroin... and 23% became addicted.  The low percentage of people interviewed who have actually tried heroin, makes the percentage more powerful.  From such a small sample group and a quarter of them became addicted?  That is huge.  Also it is ignoring that alcohol and tobacco are sold cheaply and legally and alcohol is basically a cultural norm at this point.  The majority of people interviewed in that study had tried alcohol or cigarettes. If heroin was as socially accepted as cigarettes and alcohol, the percentage would go up.  Also one thing we haven\\'t covered yet is the withdrawal process.  Heroin and cigarettes may be comparable in terms of addictiveness, but Heroin is harder to kick. Opioid withdrawal causes chills, cramps, sweating, diarrhea, nausea, anxiety, etc.  Nicotine withdrawal causes anxiety, difficulty in concentration and constipation.  Withdrawing from Heroin is a complete nightmare.   It is worth noting that heroin on its own (in proper non lethal doses) carries very little health risks.  It causes constipation and possibly some kidney damage, even after long term use. Heroin is feared as the big scary monster of the drug world, because it so hard to get off once you are addicted.   I don\\'t believe in overstating any risks.  The risk of heroin speaks for itself.  For the record, I think most drugs should be legal and ALL drugs decriminalized... But thats why its so important not to downplay the destructive nature of Heroin.  It shouldn\\'t be illegal anymore than rat poison is illegal, but it should handled with about as much care.  > I know there is a tendency to exaggerate the addictive nature of a lot of drugs, but heroin isn\\'t one of them.   Then post some sources. You are just throwing around numbers without any backup. I think you can have societal disapproval without stigma. Disapproval is finding out your friend is addicted to Oxy and forcing them into rehab. Stigma is finding out and disassociating from them because of it. Stigma makes it easy to demonize addicts as hopeless causes or less-than-people; I think society could be more open and honest about substance abuse without necessarily condoning it.  Also, not sure what OP was referring to, but some people when they talk about legalizing these drugs are referring to having them available by prescription as a treatment for addiction itself, for cases where abstinence or reduced use has not worked. Prescription drugs, in contrast, are a treatment for something else. Some people envision having even stricter legal controls than prescription drugs, eg having an injection facility where you can go for a controlled dose of heroin that never leaves the facility. There are many shades of legalization. > We can look at our society, where opiates are tightly controlled, yet we regularly read about people who got put on oxycontin for pain, became addicted, and their life goes to hell.  Poor medical practices aren\\'t a good example here. If a patient was given so many opiates they developed an addiction then that is a medical failing. If they\\'ve taken somebody else\\'s medication and developed an addiction then, again, the real antisocial problems occur when they cannot get or afford their drugs anymore. Oxycontin sells for upwards of $30 a pill on the street, it\\'s a crippling habit to afford. If they had their drugs cheaply available, or free, they would simply be an addict, not necessarily a destructive and antisocial addict.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9734   > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/28557) > When particular drugs have very statistically reliable effects on moral habits, then we have rational reason to forbid them.  I somewhat agree with this, but keep in mind the drug does not directly *cause* antisocial effects. It simply intoxicates the user and they nod off in a chair. We may condemn this behaviour as a \"waste of their life\", but it\\'s arguably similar to sitting and watching TV or playing video games for hours on end, other activities that some people (i.e.: my parents\\' generation) consider a \"waste of their life.\" The true antisocial behaviours come from the addict trying to get more drug without the means, leading to the neglect of the normal parts of their life (work, housecleaning, proper food, etc) and theft, begging, etc. It could be argued that, say, methamphetamine would be a better candidate for prohibition since the behaviour of the individual *while on the drug* is more dangerous. Then again, a heavily drunk person can be just as problematic.  I simply argue that drug prohibition is akin to abstinence-only sex education: naive and ineffective at best, and at worst actually causing more problems than it solves.  My edit for your edit: :)  > Alcohol is legal because sufficiently many people wanted it legal, whilst being able to participate in democracy, to overturn a prohibition law. Heroin is not legal because there are fewer people who want it, and they are further from democratic enfranchisement, compared to those who don\\'t do heroin and don\\'t want to pay for the resulting medical emergencies and chronic issues.  Spot on. But I believe the medical emergencies/chronic issues of addicts could be enormously reduced by treating addiction as a medical, rather than criminal problem. The prevalence of hard drugs in maximum-security prisons attests to the fact that we will *never* make them disappear, no matter how hard the police crack down, so the best we can do is harm reduction.  As an aside, we appear to have sidetracked into Ye Olde Druge Prohibition debate instead of the moral issue the OP was talking about. Sorry, I haven\\'t any idea what you\\'re trying to say here.    Another user posted a link to a study about how 1 in 4 heroin users become addition.  How is it that you think it works?  >We don\\'t exist just be facsimiles. It\\'s not how any of this is supposed to work. The social stigma you fear is an illusion.  Um, ok. I agree- the OP only mentions \"stigmas\" in the title, and doesn\\'t go on to explain it.  Blind vilification of the mistakes people make is in no way helpful.  I also am in favor of some forms of legalization.  I was merely arguing that there was plenty of good reason for society to to find things that harm society to be \"bad\".',\n \"My answer to that is 'yes'- it is moral *from their point of view*. I want to clarify here that I absolutely do not agree with moral relativism, their act is clearly not moral (in an absolute sense) but from their point of view it is.  However, I do admit that this is a confusing issue. Due to reasons outlined in my post I would never consider a christian a dick for trying to convert me- but I would consider them a dick for killing because God told them too.   Ok Ive thought about it a bit more, and damnit you have me cornered. In an absolute sense, if it's immoral to kill in the name of God (which it is) then it follows that it's also immoral to convert people to religion, in an absolute sense. ∆  I think what I was trying to get at in my post is that it's the moral duty of atheists to convert religious folk, I just came at it from the wrong angle. What are your thoughts on that, out of interest? I think what you mean is that religious people could only be consistent to their religious beliefs, and not be hypocrites, if they acted like their religion is the most important source of morality.  Thus if a Christian genuinely believe nonbelievers go to hell, it would be hypocritical, and immoral of him to not try to convert nonbelievers  You don't get to judge your own actions, that would be retarded in any system. In religion morals are take from society and then prescribed back to society as if they were bestowed by a deity onto the ordinary men of the clergy. Atheism recognizes them as coming straight from society.  I mean, no matter if you are talking social contract theory or more of an evolutionary standpoint. No matter if you get hung up on ethics vs morals. It comes from society. And it is a feedback loop. I agree with everything you wrote. I just want to focus on one thing:  > So, essentially, I don't think anyone has a moral obligation to be a vocal defender or attacker of one position or another, simply because there are too many issues out there. People should focus on what interests them and not be forced to debate things they are aware they have little knowledge of or interest in.  This reminds me of this paragraph in wikipedia you may be interested in.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism#Too_demanding  > My answer to that is 'yes'- it is moral from their point of view.  Indeed. But why even bother state this? Everyone thinks that what they do is moral. The labels 'moral' and 'immoral' are only useful insofar as they are judgements from *our* perspective used about *others*.   >In an absolute sense, if it's immoral to kill in the name of God (which it is) then it follows that it's also immoral to convert people to religion, in an absolute sense.  What do you mean 'in an absolute sense'?   >I think what I was trying to get at in my post is that it's the moral duty of atheists to convert religious folk, I just came at it from the wrong angle. What are your thoughts on that, out of interest?  Well, let's get one thing straight: atheism is a lack of a belief in god(s) (an absence of 'theism') not an organisation, creed, code, community or dogma. It's not a system or a group of any kind - it's a label referring to people who do not hold a certain belief.   We all have moral obligations - not to kill, not to lie, not to steal - etc., but I don't believe anyone has a moral obligation to espouse their viewpoint if they do not wish to.   Think of how many causes we all have viewpoints on, one way or the other. I am a supporter of feminism, animal rights, civil rights. I oppose fascism, totalitarianism, and jingoistic nationalism. But many of these topics, for one reason or another, are not really my area of interest. I love philosophy, literature, critical thinking, psychology and art. I'm neither very naturally interested in political issues, nor very intelligent at learning about or discussing them. Whereas I would say that I sympathise with - for example - the feminist cause, I am aware of my own ignorance of this issue and I do not feel I have any moral obligation to go around debating it and proselytising it. The issues which I *do* feel like debating and proselytising are ones I am more interested in, more knowledgeable on, and better at discussing.   So, essentially, I don't think anyone has a moral obligation to be a vocal defender or attacker of one position or another, simply because there are too many issues out there. People should focus on what interests them and not be forced to debate things they are aware they have little knowledge of or interest in.\",\n ' You say it\\'s intent that\\'s important. But why would intent be more important than effect? Sure, if you call your buddy a faggot behind closed doors, no one is harmed and there\\'s no real problem. But as a widespread phenomena, the world is full of a heck of a lot more people than your age group and social sphere or people with your sense of humour.  When a kid hears someone say \"gay\" or \"faggot\" as an insult, they know instinctually that it\\'s a bad thing to be. And then maybe they hurl it at someone who actually is gay, because they\\'ve been steeped in the belief that gay is bad. Maybe it didn\\'t happen around you, but it did and does happen to people our age group (I\\'m 24 too) and younger. All the fucking time. When a homophobe hears you call people faggots and gays, they think you\\'re on their side. Their viewpoint is validated. When a person whose had faggot and gay used as a slur against them their whole lives hears you say it, they feel unsafe. So yeah, to you and your friends, and some other people too, it\\'s taken on a new meaning. But to a lot of people (I would argue most people) it hasn\\'t. Especially \"gay\". Like seriously, that word isn\\'t going anywhere as a term for homosexual. So if your intent is good, why would you use \"gay\" to mean \"bad\"?  It\\'s just a joke to you, but it\\'s a lot more than that to a lot of people. Why would your joke and your good intentions be more important? > I never had a problem with the orgy joke. I approve of the orgy joke. I\\'m complaining about the subsequent \"you\\'re gay\" joke in response to the orgy joke. You missed the point of the \"you\\'re gay\" statement. The statement itself was not a joke. The joke was the orgy joke. The \"you\\'re gay\" statement was simply a response to the orgy joke. Explain how that\\'s making fun of people for being gay. > If he made a joke about a math book and you deridingly called him a dirty intellectual I would find that offensive too. That\\'s an extremely poor analogy. Calling someone a dirty intellectual is inherently offensive (since being a \"dirty\" anything is bad). Similarly, if I called my friend a \"dirty gay\", that might be offensive. However, I didn\\'t call my friend a dirty anything. I said \"you\\'re gay\" which is *not* inherently offensive (unless you\\'re homophobic). You have yet to demonstrate why responding with \"you\\'re gay\" is offensive to someone who is acting gay, particularly if the \"you\\'re gay\" statement is not itself a joke, but a reaction to a person making a gay joke.  You keep saying I\\'m poking fun at the idea of being gay, but you have yet to substantiate that claim. You\\'re saying this same thing using different sentences, but you haven\\'t provided any support for it. \"Dumb\" and \"lame\" are no longer used to mean \"mute\" and \"unable to walk\", so it\\'s just a matter of etymology. \"Gay\" still means \"homosexual\" today. Lame most certainly does. Horses are lame when they have issues. Maybe it is UK vs us but I hear people with leg issues called lame. It is still around. > Maybe if being Scottish actually had stigma and historical prejudice behind it and you\\'re actually at serious risk you might understand better. > Maybe if Scottish people and men were systemically subjected to risk of abuse, prejudice, discrimination and violence you might understand better Yeh, none of this ever happens. Also, it\\'s \"Scot\". Scott is a male first name. You might not have thought that the person you were calling gay was a homosexual, but you were perpetuating a culture that considers being gay to be a bad thing. This culture is part of the reason why bigotry against gay people is still acceptable in tons of places.  It takes basically no effort to use a different word. Even if there are people with thin skin out there, why can\\'t you just be kind and accommodate them?  Yeah I can see how that would sour the atmosphere, good thing you don\\'t let it affect you though. Yeah the thing about \\'nigger\\' is that it matters so much what tone you use, what situation you use it in and what company you keep. It\\'s definitely better to just not use it, just like with \\'faggot\\'. Read your edit, never realised it could be so hurtful. I\\'m gonna be more careful about just dropping it in, should be easy enough as I barely ever say it anyway. I\\'m sorry it\\'s that bad for you :/ Fine, I\\'ll just say this:  In your country, \"You\\'re gay\" may not be an affront to gay people (I don\\'t buy this, but let\\'s just suppose).   > So taking about having sex with the same gender? Still pretty limited. Sure, I never suggested otherwise. > And frankly even here it doesn\\'t sound ok. There is nothing wrong with having sex with the same gender. To attempt to insult someone for expressing interest in doing so is offensive. You\\'re saying it is wrong to want to do something that is gay. I never said there was anything wrong with having sex with the same gender. The phrase \"you\\'re gay\" in that context was not meant as an insult. > Obviously the orgy friend was kidding. And it seems like a harmless joke because you all know no one of you wants to sleep with the other. But to call him gay seems less playful. Explain why it seems less playful. You\\'re arguing that the orgy joke was harmless because we all knew he didn\\'t want to sleep with us. By that same logic, shouldn\\'t me calling him gay be harmless because we knew he didn\\'t want to sleep with us? Your logic seems inconsistent.  > It doesn\\'t even sound like a joke so much as shaming people for not fitting your limited idea of what a man is. Like if the joke was \"hey guys lets all try on dresses and put on makeup\" and you replied \"You\\'re a woman\" it doesn\\'t sound like a joke. It sounds like you hate the idea of doing anything women tend to do. It sounds like he made a tongue in cheek Joke and you attacked him, even if you\\'re tone was lighthearted. You keep saying \"it doesn\\'t sound like a joke\" without supporting that claim. You try to give an example with the woman scenario, but again, you don\\'t support *why* it doesn\\'t sound like a joke. Why does it sound like I attacked him? In what ways does it seem like I\\'m shaming anyone? I wrote a long winded explanation but trying to dissect humor is just so banal and pointless. Ultimately it comes down to I think thinks like gay jokes or women jokes or black people jokes only work in a context where the butt is homophobia, sexism or racism. If you are being ironic and saying something sexist or homophobic and the joke is how absurd and out of touch those sentiments are, it\\'s funny. If the butt of the joke is how dumb it is to be gay or how lame it is for a man to act like a woman or really anything that isn\\'t macho bullshit, it is offensive. I\\'ll laugh at a bigot but I won\\'t laugh at a minority if that makes sense.  Yes you have a very direct obvious example there whereas we are discussing an ambiguous statement.  Something more like, \"That is very Christian of you.\" would be a lot closer to a better analogy.  Mostly a positive term but can be used sarcastically and negatively as well so the question is not whether the statement could ever be an insult in any situation but whether or not it generally is in most situations. I do agree that implying that being gay is bad would be \"potentially\" insulting to gay people.  I don\\'t agree that using that particular phrase, \"That is gay\" actually comments on anyones sexuality a large portion of the time as the phrase has evolved to mean something else entirely.  I apologize if you feel like I am dragging this out but I think it is an important distinction to make and feels a bit sloppy to work from a view that says if someone somewhere could potentially find it insulting then it is an insult and should be avoided, some people are just overly sensitive.  The topic here is whether it\\'s insulting to gay people, not necessarily the participants of the conversation. Because the insulter meant it as bad. But it doesn\\'t really matter if the the insultee found it bad or not. The insult still puts a negative association with being gay. It\\'s not as strong if it\\'s just one guy but it\\'s still wrong. You\\'re right about lame horses — I was only thinking about humans really. And yeah, I\\'d assume it\\'s a regional thing: at least in my experience, \"That person is lame\" is at best a pun relying on the double meaning, rather than an actual description of the person\\'s disability. I\\'ve never heard someone actually self-identify as lame, while \"gay\" is the preferred term for most gay people. Look up the word gay and you\\'ll see that it used to mean carefree and then evolved and changed to mean homosexual and is still evolving and changing.  It means what society says it means and we are society.  You are acting like the OP doesn\\'t own a dictionary.  The question is about actual people in actual conversations and not a textbook definition or understanding of the situation, you aren\\'t getting that it seems which worries me.  Have a good one, if you want the last word go for it. Would you say dumb is offensive to people who can\\'t speak? Lame offensive to people who have trouble walking? No, it doesn\\'t. It\\'s possible to want to have sex with people of a certain gender, without wanting a romantic relationship out of it. Also to want a romantic relationship without sex.  Homoromantic isn\\'t a thing. It\\'s a word that was made up by Tumblrites who think that if you aren\\'t constantly having sex 24/7 you\\'re \"demisexual\". The context and meaning of the person saying the phrase determines whether the subject of the \"insult\" is offended, but it does not determine whether gay people are insulted. So taking about having sex with the same gender? Still pretty limited. And frankly even here it doesn\\'t sound ok. There is nothing wrong with having sex with the same gender. To attempt to insult someone for expressing interest in doing so is offensive. You\\'re saying it is wrong to want to do something that is gay. Obviously the orgy friend was kidding. And it seems like a harmless joke because you all know no one of you wants to sleep with the other. But to call him gay seems less playful.  It doesn\\'t even sound like a joke so much as shaming people for not fitting your limited idea of what a man is. Like if the joke was \"hey guys lets all try on dresses and put on makeup\" and you replied \"You\\'re a woman\" it doesn\\'t sound like a joke. It sounds like you hate the idea of doing anything women tend to do. It sounds like he made a tongue in cheek Joke and you attacked him, even if you\\'re tone was lighthearted.  You are assuming an environment in which being gay is seen as bad though. It\\'s like that is it? You know the \\'sexual\\' in heterosexual just refers to the sex/gender you\\'re attracted to, right? It doesn\\'t mean *having sex*. > If someone is legitimately behaving like a homosexual (playfully or seriously), then there\\'s nothing wrong with saying \"you\\'re gay.\"  How often do you see someone fucking a person of the same sex? Because if you\\'re using it in any other scenario, you\\'re wrong and you\\'re perpetuating bad stereotypes. Your queer friend is really lucky to have you, lol.  Maybe if you heard \"Scott\" used as an insult every single day throughout your life, at school, at home, on TV, online, by your parents, by your friends, by your teachers, by your heroes, 24/7 throughout your life you might understand better.  Maybe if being Scottish actually had *stigma* and historical prejudice behind it and you\\'re actually at serious risk you might understand better.  Maybe if Scottish people and men were systemically subjected to risk of abuse, prejudice, discrimination and violence you might understand better Maybe if you got regularly beaten or abused whilst having the word \"Scott\" screamed at you, you might understand better  Maybe if it was a constant thing which perpetuated real prejudice and discrimination against men or Scottish people instead of the odd sexist/Scott joke you would understand better  But no, you don\\'t care. You don\\'t care about your queer friends, you don\\'t care if you\\'re causing traumatic memories for others, you don\\'t care if you\\'re making people feel uncomfortable and annoying them by perpetuating these lazy slurs or perpetuating prejudice and validating and encouraging homophobia and discrimination with your jokes, you don\\'t even care it makes you look like an immature, insensitive, intellectually lazy empathy devoid selfish child. You don\\'t care your precious \"intent\" has little effect on whether you\\'re actually still perpetuating and validating homophobia  You just want to use your precious slurs because you aren\\'t smart enough to think of your own original insults   Again, I\\'m really jealous your queer friend has such a good ally by his side. I wish I had a heterosexual friend who cared more about perpetuating historical slurs and validating homophobia because he\\'s intellectually lazy over the well being and peace of mind of actual gay people.  He\\'s so lucky to have you! I wish I had a friend who cared more about being able to use gay slurs without being challenged than what *actual* gay people have to say about him using their namesake as an insult and a weapon to degenerate others by implying they\\'re one of you.  I would feel insulted because it was meant as an insult. If someone said \"you\\'re so cool\" in a clearly insulting and ironic way I would feel insulted even though there is nothing wrong with being cool. When they say I\\'m cool they\\'re actually saying the opposite. That I\\'m not. When they say I\\'m gay they may not mean I\\'m sexually attracted to the same sex but that it would be bad if I did. They\\'re equating homosexuality with something bad and associating me with homosexuality. Why not cut out the innocent middle man and call me directly what you think I am.  Using gay as an insult not only insults the object of ridicule (in this case me) but also anyone and everyone who associates with that thing.  > doesn\\'t that mean that if they actually are being gay, the only issue is that you are being profane No, it\\'s still homophobic. It\\'s kinda like the n-word. It\\'s still racist even if the one you\\'re using it is behaving in some way related to some stupid racial stereotypes (or they actually are black). Though your situation could have some more elaboration before judging. Like is he out and fine with that word? Did you just have a problem with him taking a video of you? Were you worried what he could/would do with the video afterwards? Did the sudden possibility of him being gay make you uncomfortable (especially in that context)? If the insulter thinks it\\'s bad then the insulter is homophobic. But if the insulted person feels insulted, it doesn\\'t necessarily mean that the insulted person is homophobic. I explain why in the OP This is really, really tacky. Don\\'t do this; it isn\\'t furthering your agenda in any way. So it\\'s pretty much bad to call someone gay unless they\\'re banging another dude, right? Or lady if she is a lady.  If it\\'s being used as an **insult** then it means the insulter considers it bad. I think bigotry is everybody\\'s problem. Or at least, everybody who would prefer a world with less bigotry. There\\'s a difference between allowing yourself to be \"censored\" and thoughtfully choosing how you interact with the world. No one\\'s forcing you not to say something, we\\'re just bringing up the pros and cons. From my perspective there\\'s a bunch of cons and very minimal pros, so it doesn\\'t seem like there\\'s good enough reason to be doing it. I never had a problem with the orgy joke. I approve of the orgy joke. I\\'m complaining about the subsequent \"you\\'re gay\" joke in response to the orgy joke.  If he made  a joke about a math book and you deridingly called him a dirty intellectual I would find that offensive too. If you\\'re making fun of him for being or even pretending to be intellectual that\\'s offensive. If it is more playful and you are poking fun at the idea that someone might dislike intellectuals that\\'s a different story. I take no issue with jokes that taken literally are anti gay, anti whatever, but that are actually meant to mock the bigots who hate them.  I know, but logically then, why is the insultee feeling bad about being called gay if they don\\'t think gay is bad too? I gave a few reasons why, do you think there are more? I agree with you fully, gay is actually used as a replacement for \\'bad\\' I guess, mainly by younger kids. I can see how its offensive to gay people. &#8710; What is the point of saying you\\'re gay in response to the joke. Is it to mock him. To support him. To redundantly state what category his statements fall under.  Can you tell us what country you live in, please?  I know you don\\'t like revealing personal information, but trust me - no one is going to track you down because they know your country.  And given the specifics of this conversation, I think it\\'s very relevant. See my above reply to u/fluffhoof > Yes you have a very direct obvious example there whereas we are discussing an ambiguous statement. Something more like, \"That is very Christian of you.\" would be a lot closer to a better analogy. Mostly a positive term but can be used sarcastically and negatively as well so the question is not whether the statement could ever be an insult in any situation but whether or not it generally is in most situations. The example was not meant to be an analogy to the gay statement. It was meant to show that something could be insulting regardless of the receiver of sender of the message, which you now seem to understand. > I do agree that implying that being gay is bad would be \"potentially\" insulting to gay people. Not \"potentially\", but \"definitely.\" It\\'s definitely insulting to gay people to imply that being gay is bad. > I don\\'t agree that using that particular phrase, \"That is gay\" actually comments on anyones sexuality a large portion of the time as the phrase has evolved to mean something else entirely. \"Gay\" still means \"homosexual\" so I\\'m not sure what you mean. Just because some people use it to mean \"stupid\" or \"bad\" doesn\\'t change the fact that homosexual people still identify with the term. In fact, the fact that some people use it to mean \"stupid\" or \"bad\" - while knowing that it means \"homosexual\" - helps my point. I really couldn\\'t care less if I\\'m validating someone else s bigotry by proxy. That\\'s their problem, not mine. What matters *is* my viewpoint when I\\'m the one who is using the word (which is just a word). The meaning and intent I put behind a word means everything with regards to the end result. To be honest though, I haven\\'t used \"gay\" to describe anything in quite a while - not sure why. At the end of the day, I\\'m not going to allow myself to either be censored because someone might find a word offensive, nor will I ever agree with anyone suggesting that I am somehow indirectly supporting bigotry by using a word in a way that has absolutely no relation to \"I hate you because you like men\". I do understand your point of view, I just don\\'t agree with it. I\\'ve experienced sexism (in the workplace) and racism (it\\'s quite fashionable when it\\'s used against Scots) towards myself so I understand that some people might automatically associated my usage of certain words with something like bigotry. We Are talking about insults. So yeah, if you hurl identities at me as insults I will be offended for those people who share that identity. The very act of using an identity as an insult is evidence that the identity is being viewed in a negative light.  Well that was easy. Imo that\\'s homoromantic more than homosexual. I was talking more about situation where a guy lisps, flailing his wrist and such and he\\'s called gay or he\\'s doing it make fun of gay people. Also it depends on the context, in some countries it\\'s normal for two guys to hold hands/kiss on the cheek when they\\'re friends. I think you\\'re seeing things where they don\\'t exist. The butt of the joke is *not* that its silly to be gay. The butt of the joke is that after a series of legitimate suggestions for evening plans, someone suggested something that was obviously ridiculous (since none of us were gay). It would be similarly funny if he said \"Yeah, and we could do math homework later\" or \"Yeah, and we could read romantic novels later.\"  These things are not funny because there\\'s something wrong about math or romantic novels. They\\'re funny because we expected him to suggest something that would actually be a plausible set of plans; instead he came up with something so unexpectedly uncharacteristic that we just had to laugh. Of course, none of this would be funny if we were actually math enthusiasts, romantic novel readers, or interested in homosexual orgies, but that\\'s exactly what makes them funny. Yup, that\\'s why it\\'s an insult. It\\'s bad to call a gay person straight and deny that they are gay too you know. > it\\'s just that they use it in ways that they can\\'t excuse, and they know they can\\'t excuse, but just don\\'t care. That\\'s messed up :/ Gay can refer to both homoromanticism, not just homosexuality.  I saw that Askreddit about people who got tracked down because of small clues building up over time so I\\'m paranoid about it. What if I told you that it\\'s a country with little stigma against gay people? At the very least, my neighbourhood is quite accepting. Right, so if someone calls you gay, e.g \\' maxpenny42 is so gay \\' would you feel insulted? What if they said you throw like a girl? And if you felt insulted does it mean you are homophobic or misogynistic? So according to you someone can be insulted without being a part of that conversation in some way?  Being insulted (the result of an insult) is a subjective experience not an objective one.  It sounds like you are speaking for a whole group of people and insisting that an insult can occur regardless of how the receiver feels or how the initiator meant it.  How is it that you get to decide the insult for them? Huh? I never said the insultee was homophobic. I said that if the insulter is going to use a word as an insult then they consider that term as bad. It doesn\\'t matter if the environment thinks its bad at that point as the insulter meant it as bad. Agreed. I think in many cases it\\'s hardly insulting, but still borderline out of bounds; it\\'s usually still attaching a negative, or dismissive, connotation to being gay, or a personal attack if the person\\'s not gay and being called so in a serious tone. The most positive context I can think of is picturing a [gabe](http://www.queerty.com/its-time-to-drop-fag-hag-and-start-using-gabe-gay-babe-20111203) (that\\'s the first thing that came up with I googled \\'pc word for a fag hag\\', and tbh: the girls are rarely babes in these situations) calling her friend \\'so gay\\', and even that  almost always sounds patronizing as hell. It seems to me, the only reason that situation even occurs, is the guy in question\\'s usually a very submissive personality that\\'s kind of into being talked down to like that. For an insult to occur the comment must be viewed as disrespectful by at least one person in that conversation.  If I use the term, \"You\\'re gay.\" in a conversation with a homosexual person and they know through the context it has zero to do with anyone\\'s sexuality then no insult can occur.   Yes, I know that. \"Homosexual\" doesn\\'t mean \"wants to have sex\". It means \"likes people of the same gender\". \"Homoromantic\" is not a thing, because \"homosexual\" already encompasses romantic attraction. I think you\\'re being intellectually dishonest. The reason it is an insult is that anyone called gay is supposed to feel bad about being called gay. The goal is the shame them into feeling inferior. Certainly the point here is that you shouldn\\'t want to be the thing you are ebbing accused of. It\\'s not as simple as being denied you\\'re own identity. It is that but also suggesting you\\'re the \"wrong\" identity.  No one goes around calling everyone they dislike straight. They call them gay. The point is to say \"you\\'re the wrong sexuality\". Not simply that you\\'ve failed to live up to your own sexuality. But that there is a good one and a bad one and you\\'re the bad one.  Think about where gay is most prominent as an insult: middle school. Kids in middle school are still trying to sort their sexuality out. It is unclear to many who and what they like. They don\\'t yet have a strong sexuality present and yet every day they are being thrown insults that say to them \"you\\'re gay. And gay is bad. You should feel bad about the idea that you might be gay\". But some of those kids are gay. They\\'re being told \"you\\'re supposed to be straight but your actually the bad sexuality. You\\'re gay. Feel bad about that\". And guess what, many do. Suicide rates are much night for lgbt teens because, in part, they\\'re told repeatedly their whole life that there is a wrong sexuality to have. And then they realize they have it.  \"That\\'s so gay\" is not a simple matter of calling someone something they\\'re not. You know this. It is obvious. Especially when it is primarily used on people who haven\\'t yet sorted their sexuality. It is about shaming people into a heteronormativity that will never work for them.  I guess I\\'m demisexual.  Not having sex 24/7 because you don\\'t feel the need.  Demisexual.  Not having sex when you want to have sex. Incel.  The Internet.  Ok I understand what you mean now. Disagree fully here.  I say, \"You\\'re stupid\" to people in a playful way all the time that communicates that they made me smile and probably laugh when they might have made a very intelligent joke or observation.  Words and terms change over time, they evolve to mean different things than the original/ literal interpretation.    Same thing here with \"You\\'re gay\".  The context and meaning of the person expressing the thought is of primary importance unless you fundamentally disagree that language evolves/ changes over time or that context is not a factor.',\n 'WRONG. It was not \"one feminist\". The video was shot by a man who was paid to do so by a women\\'s activist group. The woman was paid to walk around ignoring poor black people. And it was thousands of feminists that popularized that bit of hate speech.   Do you understand the difference? She was an actress. A white woman was cast in the role of the \"victim\" in that video. How did they \"cast\" the villains? By shooting most of their video in a poor black neighborhood in Harlem. That isn\\'t where you shoot if you want diversity. But since this is a professional publicity company doing the shooting, I\\'m not going to assume it was an accident, and neither should anyone else.  And guess what? When it comes to gender discussion, \"the establishment\" is feminism. That\\'s the  mainstream, and this wounded doe underdog act isn\\'t going to fly when your movement is making recruitment videos for white supremacist groups.  Actually, the feminist movement has always had notable friction among racial minorities in the movement. There are racial sub-groups, such as the black feminist movement, who ultimately believe in their understanding of what feminism is but know that the macromovement is ivory crafted and doesn\\'t (and to some extent can\\'t) meet the messaging and initiative needs that non-white feminists would like to see. Any feminist who has learned about the start of the movement and can take a critical look at the current movement from the perspective of those outside the movement should be able to tell you that the movement was and still is a movement seen to be spearheaded by mostly middle class white women (this a matter of the face of the movement as opposed to the actual composition of the movement). [Here\\'s a brief synopsis of the rise of black feminism as an example.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_feminism#Latter_20th_century)  [The movement was also hostile to lesbians.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Menace#Origins) Then there is still some ongoing friction within the overall movement about where trans women fit in. Some historical outlines can be seen [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgenderism_and_transsexualism#Feminist_criticism) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgenderism_and_transsexualism#Feminist_exclusion_of_transgender_and_transsexual_people)  So saying that feminism \"is becoming openly hostile to minorities, particularly poor minorities\" is a misguided analysis of the movement because it lacks acknowledgment of the movement\\'s past. Heck, the example you used demonstrates the core reason, that the mostly white figureheads of the movement overlook minority experiences, why the black feminist movement started in the first place. > Feminism is the examination of power and discrimination in society.  In this case (\"anti-feminism\"), feminism is not used in the sense of a critical discipline, but of an ideology. So it\\'s perfectly sensible to use \\'anti-feminist\\' in the same vein as \\'anti-communist\\' or \\'anti-fascist\\'. In fact, the examination of society *already has a term*, and that\\'s **sociology**.   You don\\'t get a degree in Feminism, you get a degree in Sociology. You could get a degree in \"Women\\'s Studies\" and it would be equally stupid to use the term \"Anti-Women\\'s Studies\" because Women\\'s Studies is a field of study, not an ideology. But anti-feminist? Perfectly valid. I had a bunch of stuff typed out but you pretty much hit the nail on the head, so I\\'ll just give you an upboat.  >I think being \" anti\"-feminist does point to a strange personal stance, especially for a minority.  Why? I don\\'t know a black man (or black woman for that matter) who wasn\\'t offended by the way black men-and only black men-were portrayed in that catcalling video that went viral a while back. Feminism is becoming openly hostile to minorities, particularly poor minorities. ',\n \">Additionally, buying local =/= better labor practices.      This is really two different arguments, if we assume that the local 10 acre organic tomato farm has the same labor standards as the 5,000 acre commercial tomato farm only with fewer employees, then we're just focused on an interest in keeping money closer to home. If a consumer is focused solely on labor practices, then local or not, that consumer is going to support the company with the practices he or she agrees with. I support local farms when I can but if you told me that the local farm treated its workers like shit, I would look somewhere else. That's voting with my wallet and is in fact activism.      By the way, this SJW nonsense about whitewashing and PoC is just that, nonsense. The identify of who is doing what has nothing to do with labor conditions or the benefit of buying local products.       >yet their labor relations often aren't any better than conventional industrial farms.      Who's to say that the labor relations at conventional industrial farms are so horrible? Isn't it still pitched as *helping* someone? If you want the epitome of selfish consumerism wouldn't you be looking at a company that emphasizes price rather than politics - Shop at walmart because YOU save money.

[PORTAL](https://github.com/grugq/portal/)  [GL.iNET](http://www.gl-inet.com/w/?p=492&lang=en), etc  Seems to me that if we are only trying to hide the source of the traffic it\\'d be easier to have the open router connect to a VPN or proxy from a Provider I\\'ll Allude to (seems to be a Reddit darling). There is a better point;  having an open wifi network is a defense. So they might do it (legal or not), but is it likely even in the event of a crime?

What are the chances that this will lead to a courtroom? i know this is old.... but whats stopping someone who lives next door to a starbucks from hopping on their wifi from his house?

People and technology change - more people giving out wifi, more people realizing and using it.  So the future numbers could be different when things change and the future is what you care about.  2. You don\\'t care that the average person giving free wifi doesn\\'t have this problem, you just care if it occurs to you or not.  One time it happens to you would make you regret it. > There is a better point; having an open wifi network is a defense.  In some countries you are responsible for the security and possible crimes commited from your network. Opening your network would only work against you. I would open my wifi in a heartbeat (with some minor traffic shaping to reserve some bandwith for my use) but since I live in a country where I can be held responsible for someone posting or uploading copyrighted material from my account, I just won\\'t do it.

This allows plausible deniability on a specific copyright infringement, but if your equipment is confiscated and searched, wouldn\\'t any discovered copyright infringement nullify that? It also won\\'t help if you and your \"friend\" have downloaded the same content. I used to think having an open Wi-Fi could be used as a defense, but now I think it only exposes you to a greater scrutiny. It would be difficult to prove if the person on the wifi was a customer or a nearby resident, but if you were to get passed that and know it was a resident, the police would have to grab the physical device and look for digital evidence there? Supreme Court recently ruled IP addresses aren\\'t people, and they have to have another way of identifying the person they think committed the crime.

I\\'m not sure that enough.  Even the accusation of criminal actions alone would make it a big negative.  Do cops know about IP addresses and open wifi and other technical issues or do they just understand that this telecommunications company says that the illegal activity came from this house and is paid for by this person? I\\'m talking about a generic case. Assuming TOR etc is not in the picture, for now.  IP addresses were meant to uniquely identify a device on the internet. They were not mean to locate it geographically.   However, because of the way ISPs and others decided to allocate IP address space, we ended up with geographical areas assigned a certain block of IP address space. (This is true for the general users, but mostly not true for servers and routers, the big ass core routers and servers owned by ISPs and internet companies).    So, if I see an IP address, I can pin-point to a rough geographical area where the machine with that IP address may be located. Now, usually, people are connected to a NAT Box (popularly called \\'routers\\'). This NAT Box has a public IP address and users connect to it over a private IP address. The IP address a public eavesdropper sees will be of this NAT Box.    Now, coming to TOR. TOR does route your traffic around to make it difficult to trace the source. But, someone with enough time can do it. Also, now that the FBI has it\\'s own servers serving as TOR nodes, they can trace the original IP address a little more easily.    Another way to circumvent tracing is to use VPN. But that only works as long as your VPN provider is willing to stand up to the government.   So, this is why it is possible to pin-point that a device with a X.Y.Z.W IP address may be in this rough geographical area. TOR and VPN can make things difficult, but not impossible. Also worth noting that in certain countries (Germany for instance) the owner of a network is responsible for it, and thus legally liable for crimes committed on said network. Sounds like reason for making sure that people can\\'t be put into legal hot water over a simple IP address discrepancy.  When there\\'s a problem, you fix it, not bend your life around it. I actually don\\'t think IP addresses are probable cause  >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/08/why-ip-addresses-alone-dont-identify-criminals but that\\'s not even how police find you, they simply take the ip to the isp and say \"who did you assign this IP to at this day and time and give us their account address\" with a warrant in hand.  surely ISP\\'s have these records for several years or more But insurance is there to mitigate the risk of these things jot vice versa.

We're already looking at billions of trees lost across the taiga and alpine forests of North America from these beetles. The Amazon also [lost billion of trees to drought](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/03/tree-deaths-amazon-climate) in recent years and may become a net carbon source within the next century as it begins to transition from rainforest to savanna or scrubland. A combination of heat, acidification, and anoxia is also expected to do a number on many ocean ecosystems, especially coral reefs. Just to name a few examples. Scientists have actually calculated what would happen if we experienced another period of extremely low solar activity similar to the Maunder Minimum and it would have a negligible effect on global warming. At this point, the greenhouse gases are much stronger.  http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2011/06/what-if-the-sun-went-into-a-new-grand-minimum/  There has been speculation in the past that we might be overdue for another ice age due to the fact that previous interglacial periods were about 10,000 years and the current one has gone on about 12,000 years, but more recent research suggests that previous interglacials weren't as consistent in length as previously believed and the next ice age probably isn't due for about 50,000 years.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles  http://www.aip.org/history/climate/cycles.htm It hasn't been mentioned because we have done the research.   > we do know that life usually flourish during warmer climate in earth,s cycle..  That's true, but only once it has time to adapt to the new climate. The transition periods from cold to warm or warm to cold tend to involve massive ecosystem disruptions, with many plants and animals going extinct and others exploding in population as they enter ecosystems that lack natural predators or limits on their growth. A current climate change related example is the bark and spruce beetle infestations killing forests across the Mountain West and taiga regions of North America. These were formerly held in check by cold temperatures, but now the climate has warmed enough that they experience much lower winter mortality and in some areas can even have two generations in a single breeding season, where previously they could only manage one. For example, the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska has lost 70-80% of its spruce trees within the last ~20 years. These types of disruptions happen much more quickly than the process of evolution and adaptation that will eventually heal them, which leaves the next umpteen generations of humans a world of massive ecological chaos and devastation. Why would we do that to ourselves if we don't have to? Actually technically we're still in an ice age, as we have ice at both poles of our planet. If we're in an ice age and overdue for another one... well maybe I'm missing something but I don't think that adds up.\",\n 'How else could uncaused motion occur?

For all we know, every reference to either is reference to only sex, especially because there isn\\'t any biblical text that explicitly specifies the difference.  [Life of Brian disagrees!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjz16xjeBAA) Here\\'s your ∆ ! Okay, that\\'s true. You\\'ve changed my view. Eunuchs, historically, have not been considered to be men. Do you mean the bible is not against lesbianism? > Romans 1:26 (NIV) >  Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. **Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.** Honestly, I\\'m in a lesbian relationship myself, also Christian. I take the above phrase not to be against homosexual relationships themselves, but rather sexual excess, etc. Probably only because they could not function as men, and I doubt anyone thought eunuchs were female instead. I was not aware of these genetic variations of sex. Very interesting, and I will read up on them. You\\'re spot on that our interpretation of things must change as our understanding of reality grows.  So you now believe that being transgendered is a psychiatric disorder, and you didn\\'t believe that before? Although, technically, lesbianism is not against the bible. Probably? I\\'m not an expert on what was considered cross-dressing by the Bible.  It certainly does. Although I would be curious to know if that is how her unmodified biology is or if it is the result of treatment.  It\\'s still not, in their eyes, an innate property. No dick = not a dude. Chromosome is just a blue print. Those with XY can still grow a vagina in the womb.  many animals have their sex determined by environment and not genes. Sea turtles for example determine their sex by incubation temperature (fun story of how thst was figured out. To help sea turtle conservation scientists would gather all the eggs they could find off the beach. Eventually they realized they had been releasing all males due to that aspect of incubation).  Traditionally the way to determine if an animal is male or female is by the size of their sex gamete. Large sex gamete aspects female small are male.  ...no it doesn\\'t? I don\\'t see how you could possibly read that as saying \"women, go be lesbians.\" Deltabot, you gave the delta to the wrong person! That\\'s pretty damned vague.  \"Unnnatural [sexual relations]\" could be just about anything.   Conversely, there\\'s another passage in the bible which explicitly instructs you to be a lesbian. I actually agree with your original premise. Prior to the distinction being made, this was a point of ambiguity (requiring the new terminology to be created), rather than the two concepts being identical. Either way, thank you for my first delta! Being transgendered is not a disorder, however gender dysphoria is inherently a disparity between biological and mental gender state.  It is a psychological condition at root as the biology is not at fault here.    Not necessarily. You could also define gender as an innate property rather than a state of being. Even if I underwent a transgender operation, or even if I lacked any genitalia, I still am a male, because I can\\'t change who I _am_. Fashion changes with the times, believe it or not it used to be frowned upon for women to wear pants instead of dresses. Would that have been considered cross dressing if it was not accepted?  Does a person\\'s primary sex hormone make the biological distinction, or their X vs Y chromosome? I think it would be the chromosomes because that can\\'t be changed. However that is not a hard boundary on gender because we have awesome things like hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery and just generally feeling/acting the way that feels right for the individual.  Funny thing about that verse is because they gave up god he took straight people and turned them over to lust where then they committed homosexual acts. To me it\\'s the lust part that\\'s wrong as lust does not define a sexuality. Besides what happened to the lgbt people who were celibate and gave up on him did he turn them straight burning in their lust for what was unnatural to them? It only shows what happened to straights. > So as long as you don\\'t have same sex partners, being transgender is still fine? If you read OP\\'s post, apparently the Bible also prohibits cross-dressing, so, no, that would imply that the only situation where being transgender is fine is where you don\\'t have same sex partners, don\\'t present as the other gender, and don\\'t attempt to physically alter your sexual characteristics. I imagine that\\'s how trans people in the past handled it; by keeping it secret. The view stated in the OP has actually not changed that much. However, a lot of related beliefs (The network that belief is contained within) have changed. no, not really due to some of the other points that have been made in this thread. The most important ones being on the definition of gender. At the moment, I put it in the same class of things as severe depression and ADHD rather then things that are morally wrong. While it does certainly lend it\\'s self towards doing things that are wrong, so does ADHD so there is not much room for complaint there. Well all he talks about is gender as a broad term, so my opinion would be if he\\'s NOT actively taking a position against it he doesn\\'t care. If he doesn\\'t care, then by definition transsexualism is not sinful. Okay - but if the Bible is divine mandate, we can\\'t assume that God wasn\\'t making the distinction - no? I\\'m getting tired, it is about to be my bedtime. Can you clarify this for me? You seem to be thinking about intersex disorders in human, but you\\'re responding to a comment that is just discussing things like how snakes and other reptiles have the opposite of XY where males have the same sex chromosomes and females have different (which is how that female snake that got on the front page a few months back for its virgin birth made a boy snake) as well as other speciwass where there is no sex chromosomes and the genes are prepared to make either male or female depending on environmentnal needs. All those methods are standard options, no negative associations.  *phenomenon If you\\'re already a lesbian (or bisexual woman) and you read that, it\\'s saying \"don\\'t lay with man as you lay with woman.\"  In other words \"stop having sex with men, but women are fine.\" I was referring specifically to the words themselves, rather than the concepts. Your example from other cultures fits into my qualification that I made to /u/SobanSa. As far as the English language is concerned: From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction#Gender) > In the Oxford English Dictionary, gender is defined as, \"[i]n mod. (esp. feminist) use, a euphemism for the sex of a human being, often intended to emphasize the social and cultural, as opposed to the biological, distinctions between the sexes.\", with the earliest example cited being from 1963 ^^^Yes ^^^I ^^^know ^^^this ^^^is ^^^mostly ^^^a ^^^quote ^^^from ^^^a ^^^second ^^^source ^^^>_< So as long as you don\\'t have same sex partners, being transgender is still fine?   Although that makes me wonder about hermaphrodites. Are they for ever doomed?  Technically, SobanSa gave it to the wrong person. We also have XXX, XXY, and similar genetic disorders, some of which result naturally in people growing to adulthood believing they are cis and have a \"normal\" gender, when their \"birth sex\" may genetically have been different than they present in their adulthood. Conceptually, when we knew little of science, it makes sense that gender was treated like sex, but as technology and science has progressed and we\\'ve changed with time as our understanding has broadened, it seems silly to disregard the distinction between sex and gender just because we couldn\\'t understand them back when the Bible was being written.       Just like the bans on thing like consuming shellfish and pork and having women speak in temples/churches, we can continue to set things aside as our understanding of the world broadens. It is now safe to consume shellfish and pork as well as beef and dairy touching. It no longer somehow aids our society to keep women from participating in certain things. Likewise, we can allow ourselves to have a broader understanding of sex and gender, just like the world is coming to have a broader understanding of love.  That makes sense. Have a ∆ for adding that to my perspective and so changing it. Leviticus 18:22 \"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.\" If you read that as a man, it says \"don\\'t be gay.\"  But if you read it as a woman, it says \"gay it right the fuck up.\" So the bible is the word of God, God being omniscient would understand the concept of fluid gender and transsexualism - so we can therefore assume that he dictates accordingly, with no opposition to it?  There is no one who is arguably transgender in the bible, so it\\'s difficult to say. Understanding something =/= thinking it is a good thing. It is possible that he does not oppose it. (We are talking about something that is not mentioned directly in the bible.) However, that is far from a set conclusion. This is a good point. ∆ In that if sex and gender are considered the same thing, then it implies a biological definition of gender. I\\'m actually not concerned about the science of the thing, so much as what OP believes, and how this thread has actually changed his view.  You have been of some help. ∆ In that if sex and gender are considered the same thing, then it implies a biological definition of gender. This is why I made the comment that it\\'s (probably) only relevant in the modern day (I have no idea if there were other means in the past), as the hormone situation is due to treatment. That doesn\\'t make it any less true however that her body, as of right now, is more biologically female than male.   Every single one has negative effects associated with them.  You don\\'t have incorrect chromosomes without serious issues. The distinction between sex and gender is a very recent phenomena, so no. Got to say, this goes against my understanding of 1: the first name of G-d and 2: the weird shifting gendered terms in the Song of Songs. I would argue that the ancient Israelites had a more complex understanding of sex/gender than we may assume and that this may be partially obscured by a historical moment in which binary normative roles where up held strictly. I don\\'t think we have good evidence to think that they did believe sex/gender where the same, or that they didn\\'t.  It is not a new phenomena for peoples to have fluid understandings of gender and more than two gender positions.   This casts even greater doubt that they had a strict legal prejudice against it as the ancient Israelites lived in a trade nexus and likely interacted with lots of different peoples and no explicit prohibition is mentioned of non normative genders,  there is the line about not cross dressing to decieve, but I suspect that is more about getting out of military service than it is about sexual identity.  This ofcourse is just my opinion. No. That\\'s why I\\'m asking the Sunday school teacher if this is a thing. I don\\'t know that that\\'s a completely fair argument, though.  That\\'s making the assumption that the primary sex hormone is the sole determining factor of one\\'s biological sex. That\\'s exactly what he\\'s saying I was not sure what it was. However, I knew that based on my observation of the bible what it could not be. Then it\\'s likely that past commentaries have interpreted sex and gender as the same thing, which is the root of the controversy. Sorry, I haven\\'t been of much help. So do you now believe that the Bible does condemn being transgendered? I actually said this above to another commenter and (edit: probably) only applies to the modern day, but I have a transgender friend who once pointed out that while she may have the sexual organs of a male, the chemical makeup of her body is biologically female, as she now has far more of the estrogen (female) hormone than testosterone (male) hormone. The chemical makeup of her body literally indicates that she is female, even if she has an organ associated with being male. This makes the \\'biological\\' sex argument a little more complicated.   >Conversely, there\\'s another passage in the bible which explicitly instructs you to be a lesbian. What passage is that? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system Just tossing this here in case anyone wants to read up more on the different sex determination systems. I was unaware that there were so many options.  A transgender friend of mine actually pointed out once that while she may have the sexual organs of a male, the chemical makeup of her body is now female. Her primary sex hormone is estrogen, making her biologically female. Just another point to consider.  ∆ For giving me an additional perspective on gender to the ones I had been considering.

CE/BCE is not a new concept.  It\\'s been referenced for 300 years now.  Jewish scholars started using it, not just to be \"pretentious\", but because referring to the birth of Jesus as \"Christ\" is a direct contradiction to their faith.  They *don\\'t* believe that Jesus was the Christ, so to go around saying \"Oh, but that was the year that the Christ came\" literally goes against everything they believe in.   And it\\'s far from just English.  Most languages around the world have some form of this, as well. You talked about goodbye and showed us how we took one Phrase that was entirely religious and evolved it and changed it into a secular phrase with no religious connotation.   We are doing the same with AD and BC just differently. We are taking the secular part (counting time) and losing the religious part. Just like we took a greeting and stripped it of its religiousity.  If I may offer a different take on this, I would argue that there is a reason to have words which mark one as pretentious and priggish. It\\'s the same reason we can say \\'proceed\\' rather than \\'go ahead\\': they denote exactly the same thing in almost every circumstance, but it does have that more official connotation. It helps the reader understand the nature of the author and of the text. In the same way, using CE and BCE make the text sound  more academic.  Also, I don\\'t see why you see this as anti-Christian. It feels a little persecution-complexy - we\\'re still using the date scale precisely because it would be too much of  a hassle to switch over. The small change in what we call it is just a little bit of a nod to the vast majority of history which had little or nothing to do with Christianity. When I feel like taking offense at something trivial I can easily construe CE as offensive.   AD admits that this is a Christian calendar we\\'re using. There are other religious calendars; we\\'re on year 5775 of the Hebrew calendar. People say AD to make it clear they\\'re referencing the Christian calendar, possibly for convenience. They might not be Christian but they need a common numbering system.   CE implies that *everyone* should consider the putative arrival of the Christian messiah as ushering in a new era for humanity. By saying that the Christian calendar is the \"common\" one, it\\'s positioning Christianity as the default, the center, implying that everything else is niche or an aberration.  There is a huge difference between a common contraction of a sentence which has evolved into it\\'s own word, and an initialism.  \"BC\" is just \"Before Christ\", there wasn\\'t any modifications made to make it less religious, and as a result, those who do not worship Christ could reasonably find \"BC\" out of place in their vocabulary as they do not think the history of time revolves around one man\\'s life.

Just because there is a silver lining to censorship, that at least artists can always create something else, (that might be even more original), that doesn\\'t mean that censorship is an entirely neutral or good thing, it\\'s still messing with artists to protect others.   When the Hayes Code banned sex and violence in movies, that led to the rise of the bible epic genre, since those were still allowed to be violent and sexy as long as they followed the gcripture. Great classics, like The Ten Commandments, and Ben-Hur, were born that way.   This doesn\\'t mean that the Hayes Code was a great thing, it was still petty censorship, and competent artists could have just as easily created something great *without it*.   Just because the public is forbidden from making a Mickey Mouse cartoon, or a Star Wars movie, or write a Narnia novel, doesn\\'t mean that what they do instead of it is any better.

But that dynamic could also be expanded to much younger works, if only they were Public Domain.   Maybe there are so few public domain based works, because by necessity they are all forced to be period pieces, which is a single niche. Cut copyright back to the original 28 years, and you would see the same principle apply to Superman, Star Wars, Spiderman, Lord of the Rings, etc. Right now, we are getting their sequels up the wazoo, because as long as a single company owns them, they all serve as little monopolies, edges that they can use to undercut each other, by holding our yearly doses of them.

If we did pull the copyright would people suddenly spring up to turn him into a fleshed out character?  No - you might as well start with your own character as using him wouldn\\'t save you any work.  What it would do is cause an economic disruption to the Disney corporation, reduce its profitability, and force it to pour money into a new symbol that it would now have to worry about expiring with time as well.  We would be destroying Disney\\'s goodwill without creating anything in turn.  Who would benefit by putting Mickey in the public domain?  I am sure there are a lot of people out there who are eager to put him into pornography as a way of both shocking people\\'s sensibilities (specifically because he is such a recognized symbol), and shitty warehouse owners eager to make a few bucks stamping out cheap, crappy, mouse ears.  Why on earth should be be helping those people?  Yes copyright\\'s origin is providing content creators, and their families, a stream of income from the fruits of their work during their lifetimes, but surely if a piece of IP is still producing huge revenues close to a hundred years on we are dealing with something outside of that view that is also worth protecting.

But if I wanted to actually contribute something to the public, some smart commentary I had about Mickey Mouse, I could do it in different ways.  I can make Road Runner without the road runner being Mickey Mouse.  I can make spaceballs without apropriating the star wars name.  I can make fifty shades of grey without appropriating twilight. Heck it is actually really rare for someone to take a public domain work and really do something of public merit with it.  What public domain really does is stop us from having to figure out who owns, and how much they should be paid, every single little piece of media that is ancient.  That is a hugely useful function in this day and age but no one is out there trying to remake the vast, vast, majority of old public domain works.    Where there are exceptions to this the new author is creating their own value as opposed to just appropriating it.  You want to make a Dracula movie, a From the Earth to the Moon remake, a Pride and Prejudice Series you had better be bringing something new and wonderful to the table or it is going to flop and you will lose a bunch of money.  The simple fact that Pride and Prejudice is being remade isn\\'t automatically going to turn out crowds - you have to market, you have to show people you got something good for them.  Ok so there are 2 reasons I said my predicted scenario is likely. Going back to the Spiderman example, there are 2 reasons a company may produce a derivative work if they see the property to be valuable enough to keep others from using it: >a) other companies don\\'t make money and b) if they ever do get the rights, it now has a negative rep in the public\\'s eye, making it less valuable  I\\'ll add to that: c) if a company can produce a movie that is of actual low quality, but still very profitable (like a scaled down Michael Bay summer blockbuster) they can not only use that fulfill continued use requirements but also use it to market other products, like toys and such. Even if they barely break even on the film, profit from other sources might be enough to make such an act worthwile  So here are 3 potential motives for a company to make a derivative work instead of letting it go to the public.  In response to your side note, I don\\'t think any proposed solution could be achieved that current copyright holders would find agreeable (as they would inevitably be on the losing end of such an agreement). Also, I think the only real solution would be to either 1) drastically decrease the length one can hold a copyright, or 2) condition copyright claims not on continued \"use\" but on continued investment of *financial resources* with respect to the company\\'s financial assets. Neither idea is fleshed out at all, but I can think about it more if you\\'d like  (also, it might take a while for my next response, so sorry about that in advance) > Somehow, god knows how, kids today still know who he is and want to see him when they go to disney world. So why on earth would we want that copyright protection to evaporate?  Because it\\'s popular, therefore the public has an interest in it.   If it would evaporate, anyone could make *mouse ear hats* make MickeyMouse cartoons, and our pop-culture would be freer for it.   Copyright exists for our sake, not for Disney\\'s. We give up part of our freedom and ability to copy, to sell, to produce, to sing, to watch, and even to create art,  so artists can have a stable revenue stream from monopolizing these options, and they can exist in an industry, and create more art *for us*.   The goal is not just to let them earn as much money as they can, but to let them earn as much money as absolutely necessery, before we can lift these monopolies and censorship restrictions from the public.   Do we, as a society, benefit from Disney making billions from old franchises, or we would be better off if after an initial theatre run, and a few years of merchandising (which easily profits several times over for anything but huge flops), it would be free for all others to have a go at it?  Actually I think OP is on to something.  Lets take three examples: Mickey Mouse, Elvis, and Animal Farm.  All of these were huge when they came out.  All of these were deserving of copyright protection.  Yet how do we decide when that protection should be evaporated?  Why not make one of the relevant factors a continued use of the copyright?  For example Disney is producing millions of mouse ear hats per year and using that little guy as a mascot like crazy.  Somehow, god knows how, kids today still know who he is and want to see him when they go to disney world.  So why on earth would we want that copyright protection to evaporate?    Animal farm on the otherhand is a tremendously important work but no one is going to be making a movie of it to preserve the copyright in it.  It is still probably selling a pretty good number of copies every year but at some point no one is still investing in it and it should pass to the public domain as the author has reaped the vast majority of the financial rewards that could be taken from his work.  Elvis is another good example.  Still a huge fan base and they should be able to keep churning out CDs, coffee mugs, etc.  But you can see that it is already getting a bit long in the tooth.  Kids today don\\'t ask for trips to graceland, elvis did not turn into the next disney and we can see that ten, twenty, thirty years into the future no one is going to want to be reinvesting into the life of elvis for the sake of preserving a few tens of thousand a year in content sales. >but my idea of it wouldn\\'t consider that to count (and this would need to be reflected in the definition).  The biggest issue I see is that there is no way to appropriately make a legal definition for \"use\" of a copyrighted idea that would exclude derivative works, and as a result such valueless pieces of \"art\" would be churned out to meet the \"continued use\" requirements, and that these have negative value as \"art\"  >The copyrighted work itself would have to be made available, not just something based on it.   There are all sorts of issues with drawing the line, for instance is a \"purposefully\" bad rendition of the original idea (for sake of, say, parody or comedic purposes) legally distinguishable from a legitimately bad production? I guess you could say common sense, but then again with things like comedy, some old judge is definitely going to hold different views than, say, your average college student. Is there any way to actually write continued use laws to exclude such legitimately bad productions, while also not going overboard and crossing the brink of censorship?  >Or are you suggesting that all media would become low-budget and not as good because of this?  I don\\'t think all media will succumb to this, but highly valuable properties certainly will. Say you\\'re a company that holds the rights to Spiderman, and you personally don\\'t have access to the writers/staff/whatever to make a really good Spiderman movie. Instead of giving it up to another company that could make one, you could just as easily make a really *bad* Spiderman movie that they can still make a slight profit off of (because it\\'s Spiderman) so that a) other companies don\\'t make money and b) if they ever do get the rights, it now has a negative rep in the public\\'s eye, making it less valuable   Ultimately I think it\\'s better that we let certain ideas remain unused, than create restrictions that would only encourage the production of meaningless movies/shows, which is what I believe to be the inevitable fate of \"continued use\" provisions',\n 'The site OP links to, Box Office Mojo,  defines Wide Release as such  >Box Office Mojo considers a movie in Wide Release or about to go Wide when it is playing at 600 or more theaters, which generally indicates a nationwide release (the term is short for \"nationwide\"). A movie is considered to be in Limited release when playing at less than 600 theaters, i.e., released in one or more markets but not nationwide.  This site is also used as the source for wikipedia for what a wide release film is.',\n \"Depends on the serial killer, I'm guessing.  Why not?  Plenty of serial killers are probably out on the loose right now.  Some get caught years later, some confess years later, some disappear.  Just because they did a string of murders, it doesn't mean they'll continue and the ones that continue eventually get caught.  The smart ones that know they can't get away with it forever will stop.  Being a psychopath, losing the freedom to even have the potential to kill again is probably worse than practicing self control and not killing.  Also, it's a bit tougher to get away with serial killing these days.  Especially if you have a modus operandi that has been analyzed already by law enforcement. It's possible, but the person has to want to do it. This is sort of why I brought up pedophiles.  I guess I could add serial rapists to the mix?    If violating another human being in a certain way releases all the fun chemicals that makes you feel good, it's probably gonna be mentally addictive.  Just like how food becomes addictive for certain people going through depression, chopping a person into nice even pieces could be what works for a serial killer that's unable to fit into society.  The only difference is that it's not chemically induced, so there's no chemical dependency to worry about.  The big worry is how fucked their brain's wiring is that they've come to enjoy killing people in a methodical way and if they have the ability to rewire themselves into controlling those urges.  If you look at an alcoholics anonymous program, that's pretty much all it is.  A big, long self reprogramming. But would they be willing to control it? Is that even in the realm of possibility, if, as you say, it is an addiction? &#8710; This really put it in perspective for me. I understand the way addiction works (not personally, but through my own research), so thinking of it in this manner really broke it down for me in a clear manner.  The only question that remains is does being a murderer affect the body in the same way (albeit obviously a bit differently) as a drug? If so, treatment would be a bit easier to figure out. And if the serial killer wants to be rehabilitated, then they can find help.  Once addicted to a drug, is it possible to be rehabilitated?   \",\n 'It\\'s interesting to see that operatic singing has been relegated to the realm of freaks with enormous voices and folks \"just born with it.\"  There are a multitude of roles in the repertoire for [lighter or \"smaller\" voices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXA2Ua4wd0I), and they must cultivate the skill of singing into a large theater and over an orchestra just as well as the [Brünnhildes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRj9f3PCe0M).

Perhaps it is because I was raised in a household where improper grammar was actually forbidden, but I *always* feel like I have to use correct grammar no matter what the situation.   > but if you\\'re trying to make a good impression on someone that you know values proper grammar, then you can\\'t stop them from thinking you\\'re an idiot if you say \"I are going to the store.\"  Of course someone saying \"I are going to the store\" is going to tip me off that someone isn\\'t very intelligent. After all, this is a grammar rule that everyone should know. I don\\'t consider it a \"pesky\" grammar rule.   For the sake of argument, lets replace \"I are going to the store\" with \"to who?\"   If you are trying to make a good first impression on someone that cares about proper grammar, he would still think you to be unintelligent. (as you just broke a grammar rule)  If this were a casual conversation, I don\\'t believe he should be justified in thinking that the person was unintelligent. I think that you should be able to say \"to who?\" in a casual conversation.   > You\\'re not required to know the capital of Minnesota, either, but if you go around saying it\\'s Duluth, it\\'ll tip me off that you might not be all that intelligent (just an example.)  I see it as something more like this:  you are not required to know the capital of Texas, but if you go around saying it\\'s Houston, it *shouldn\\'t* tip me off that you might not be that intelligent.  hope that makes sense.          This is not a black/white issue. I *don\\'t* think that we should make a list of things that are ok not say. Just as you said, it will vary from person to person.   That being said, I think that we can all agree that subject-verb agreement (ie \"I *am* going to the store\" vs \"I are going to the store\") is more important than the difference between \\'lesser\\' and \\'fewer\\'  I think that everyone shouldn\\'t be required to use all grammar rules in certain situations. Which grammar rules they decide that they want to use and not use is up to them. That *doesn\\'t* mean that everyone gets an excuse to use improper grammar whenever they want, but it does mean that they can disregard rules that deem odd.   > The rules of grammar attempt to give us an objective basis on which to judge the correctness of someone\\'s speech.  That isn\\'t the objective of grammar. The objective of grammar is to insure clarity of communication. Some of this clarity, I believe, should be sacrificed for ease of conversation. Yes, we can use it to judge the correctness of someone\\'s speech, but that\\'s not what grammar is for.  > what you\\'re basically arguing for is for everyone to lower their standards.  Yeah, that\\'s exactly what I\\'m arguing. I believe that people should not be expected to follow all grammar rules in some situations. If you would rather, I can reword it:  So, you think Shakespeare, Keats and Shelly don\\'t know English grammar? There seem to be two different groups with slightly different grammar rules.  Who am I to say that one of these self-consistent sets of grammar rules is objectively wrong and the other set is objectively right?  I also wouldn\\'t call uses of negative concord (i.e. the grammar rule that negative and positive words need to agree, as seen with \"I ain\\'t never seen nothing like that\") objectively wrong English.  It\\'s not a feature of Standard American English and would be out of place in a scholarly article, but then again, contractions would also be out of place.  edit: fixed typo I know the rules of grammar and yet I break them anyway. A lot of rules of grammar are pretty pedantic, and you\\'ll come off as such if you make it known that people around you are \"talking wrong.\"  Congratulations: Shakespeare, Darwin, Kelly, Keats and Shelly think you\\'re wrong!  This was actually a bit of a trick question.    The general rule with who vs whom is that who is used with subjects but whom is used with non-subjects.  But we have an interesting case here: it\\'s the subject of the clause it logically belongs to (\"will one day be king\"), but not the subject of the overall relative clause (because the subject of the relative clause is \"everyone\").   The problem is that there\\'s no real standard agreement for which is the actually important clause: well regarded style guides and authors come down on different sides of the issue. Well, at that point you\\'re kind of trying to tell people what to think.  If I think someone is an idiot, then that\\'s my opinion, and there\\'s nothing anyone can do about it.  Just like if I go around speaking with proper grammar among people who don\\'t, they\\'ll likely think I\\'m a pretentious douche.    Austin is objectively the capital of Texas.  The rules of grammar attempt to give us an objective basis on which to judge the correctness of someone\\'s speech.  YOU don\\'t have to think someone is dumb for thinking Houston is the capital of Texas, but I do, and what you\\'re basically arguing for is for everyone to lower their standards.  > Grammar is not difficult and it\\'s not a chore to speak properly.  Which is correct:  > We are speaking to a man whom everyone seems to think one day will be king.  or  > We are speaking to a man who everyone seems to think one day will be king. > \\xa0we should still be speaking Latin, because English is just wrong Latin mixed with German.\\xa0  You\\'ve got that exactly backwards.  Old English is a Germanic language, which means it\\'s part of a language family that includes Dutch, German, Icelandic, Swedish and Danish.  English did not come from German, though; that\\'s equivalent to saying humans came from chimpanzees.  Middle English simplified the grammar of Old English (for example, Old English, like Latin, declined nouns based on which part of a sentence they were.  Middle English, like modern English, mostly doesn\\'t) and added in a lot of Latin and Norman vocabulary. > insure  ensure*  Sorry, had to ;)  Alright, this one is a little tougher to argue, because now you\\'re just talking about opinions.  For the most part, I think this is already pretty true, actually, so I don\\'t think it needs improving.  In a conversation, I\\'m not as formal as I am when I type, even in a casual setting like this.

The market is a concept that is applied in almost every subfield.  \"The market\" is not a singular concept that operates based on one theory. Views on how real-life markets operate are extremely diverse.  >Right.. this is how every field works. But the refinement makes asymptotic progress. If you start by modeling the earth as flat, you can still effectively navigate short distances. For slightly longer distances, you can just add correction terms to explain discrepancies. But to get to the precision of GPS, you would either need armies of mathematicians constantly adding models for different kinds of trajectories that add different variables (how does the distance change as the altitude is changing?), or you could change the geometry you\\'re using.  > The market is a specific \"geometry\" of how people decide what to buy. The game is another. Game theory is a good example of an alternative framework. And there could easily be more.

I\\'m sorry but your initial assumptions on how economists view markets are just wrong. I\\'ve explicitly detailed how and why for you in my previous post. As such, the premise that economists are starting off by modeling with knowledge akin to \"the earth as flat\" as their starting premise is simply faulty.  >The fact is, it takes more work to do it. It take more time, it takes better paid economists, so it happens with less frequency than the application of a simpler framework.  Again, it works the other way around. Economic research that is not utilizing as inclusive and extensive modeling as possible to account for as many variables are often too simply and thus dismissed in economic theory.  The leading schools of thought and economic theory are backed with extensive and far-reaching math.   That\\'s like saying because the math is harder to do, physics is dominated by theories using simple mathematics and elementary modeling. That\\'s just untrue. While simpler modeling is easier to do in both fields, they\\'re taken less seriously.  >I agree, it has an effect. Sometimes it\\'s the primary effect. But, when you have to correct the math for every little cost that comes up, you\\'re never going to be able to take it all into account.  The consequence of economic modeling is that some variables will inevitably be left out. They cannot all be considered. That is impossible to do. That is why economists try to capture as much of them as possible. You won\\'t get a 100% accurate replication of the real world. That is, again, impossible. But you will get the best amount of information about it given the constraints.',\n 'Same if a man lies about having a vasectomy. That\\'s not illegal, and then the woman is stuck pregnant.   Condoms being lied about can give someone STIs, a risk they aren\\'t consenting to if you have both agreed on using protection. I believe, personally, that poking a hole in a condom should count towards that as well since its voiding the protection that a condom affords. But that has nothing to do with financial abortions.   Biology is inherently unfair, and society tries to do what is best for society as a whole. At the moment, that means men have to pay for the children they have created.  Adoption requires nine months of being fed on by a fetus you don\\'t want, and having all of the chemical changes that are trying to force you into caring for the baby. It will change a woman\\'s body forever. It can (and often does) result in extended emotional issues.   By the time an abortion occurs, those chemical changes are already taking place. There is a huge amount of social stigma attached to having an abortion. There is a lot of emotional involvement. It\\'s not easy to make that decision. Especially if you want the child, but can\\'t afford it on your own.  I\\'d be inclined to think a hybrid approach could work. A half-assed implementation follows:  The father is permitted to financially abort, but loses any right to see the child (something similar to a restraining order). The state steps in.  I\\'d be potentially worried, about the mechanics of the restraining order, but would want some sort of legal framework to ensure the father is not in any way involved with the child if he choses to let the state pay for it.  This could potentially be a way bigger hassle for everyone than the state paying for it to begin with, although that raises a bunch of other complications. Generally I\\'m not opposed to welfare, and am opposed to attempts to fight against welfare fraud (as they\\'re largely ineffective and a money sink), but I also don\\'t think I would be super happy having a single parent with 8 kids getting income per child from the state because they can\\'t wear a condom. These could probably be handled with better sex ed and condom distribution, but that doesn\\'t tend to go over well in parts of the US. Yes, rape does not apply in most cases.  But when it does apply, it is abominable that  merely having a penis makes a man guilty enough to legally force child support. \"She made a choice with a foreseeable outcome and is being held responsible for that choice.\" Is that a valid excuse to ignore a women\\'s autonomy? Is it a valid excuse to ignore a man\\'s autonomy? What\\'s the difference besides bias?  No matter what the law says the parents can or can\\'t do, its the child that gets screwed. If your argument is that it\\'s unfair for men to be able to \"sign a paper and have the baby just disappear\" while women \"have to go through an invasive medical procedure\", the conclusion isn\\'t that men should be made to pay child support for 18 years but that the man should be made to pay for the procedure.  If you go on vacation and leave a stinking pile of garbage for your neighbors to deal with the fair thing isn\\'t to to make you carry out your neighbors trash for the next 18 years but to make you compensate your neighbors for having to clean it up. No control? He made a choice with a foreseeable outcome and is being held responsible for that choice.  Not necessarily, he could\\'ve placed too much trust into contraceptives. >Are you saying that a man cannot force a woman to be a biological mother against her consent? Because that\\'s very, very wrong in many ways.  No, it is not.  If a woman gets pregnant, and doesn\\'t want to be a biological parent, she may abort. Or she may choose not to abort, but it is her choice and only her choice. That is due to biology.  If a man impregnates a woman and doesn\\'t want to be a biological parent...he can do nothing (even if financial abortion was legal). He has no choice as to whether the woman births or aborts the child, it is her choice only. That is due to biology.  That is what I am talking about. Not rape.  >You\\'re only giving examples here about forced fatherhood, which in the grand scheme of things isn\\'t really a huge percentage of children that make it to birth.  All fatherhood that is not consented to is forced.   >In the few examples you provided you\\'re correct- the father should have no obligation to provide financially for the child. But only in those circumstances  Nope. No man should be obligated to pay for a child that he never wanted, just as no woman is. > But having sex doesn\\'t enter you into a binding contract, even consensual sex. And a man isn\\'t contractually bound to compensate for an agreement he never made.  You can state that, but it\\'s not true just because you state it. There are lots of people who claim they don\\'t have to pay taxes because they never agreed to (ie \"freemen\"), and it just plain doesn\\'t work. You can\\'t boil a social issue down to simple contract law. If you could, slavery would still be legal.  If the law says you have a legal obligation to support your offspring, then you do. Don\\'t like it, fix the law. But you can\\'t pretend the law doesn\\'t exist when it\\'s inconvenient.  Contracts are ONLY enforceable if society chooses to enforce them, and ONLY on the terms society deems appropriate. That\\'s why a contract that *should* be valid, like an agreement between a prostitute and her customer, is not enforceable in areas where prostitution is illegal, and a contract to marry off a 9 year old is perfectly valid and enforceable in some jurisdictions even though it should not be.   **Contracts are not magical.** They have no power other than what society says they have. And society cares more about children\\'s rights than and adults rights because adults have more options and choices than kids. To you, it\\'s a support payment, to a kid, it\\'s survival. Again, don\\'t like it, change it. But that\\'s the current state of affairs.  Here is the thing. Society has a responsibility to make sure that children are taken care of. Every politician ever elected will tell you that one of their platforms was the protection of the innocent. It\\'s not up for debate.  The real question is, who should pay? Me, as a taxpayer? I didn\\'t didn\\'t get anyone pregnant. Even if a guy was fraudulently made a father, he STILL has more of a connection to the child than I do. Than anyone does.  Is that fair? No. Is it more unfair than creating a system where anyone could abandon a child at anytime for any reason? No. And that\\'s where we are: the lessor of 2 evils.  It\\'s not about fairness. It\\'s about choosing a lesser wrong over a greater one. The father might feel innocent in all this, but the kid is even more innocent. Pure and simple. I know this because I asked the same question in law school and got the same answer from someone who was not only a law prof, but also a family court judge.  Bottom line, legally, you are responsible for the results of your actions. And even when you are not responsible for your actions due to drunkeness or fraud, they were STILL your actions, not some random strangers. You are more closely connected than a random stranger on the other side of the country. Therefore it\\'s more fair to dump the problem on you than them.  **Where things are not fair is that men and women are currently held to different levels of responsibility.** That\\'s the real crux of the issue. Arguing contract law creates a very weak position. It\\'s just plain a bad argument. There are better ones to use.  **The real issue is the difference in obligations between men and women, and the lack of consequences for misbehavior resulting in a child. That\\'s not contract law**. Bringing in contract law just weakens any arguments you may have. Never use contract law if you have any other option. It\\'s almost always the weakest argument. Well if I read what they were saying right it would just be like if any other stranger was harassing you and your child. I don\\'t know though.  Theoretically you could be exempt by either obtaining a vasectomy or being certified as sterile by a doctor and submitting the appropriate paperwork. I don\\'t think that was rude, no worries. I was mainly just wondering on your thoughts of how similar the financial abortion and the adoption processes should be.   I think if I was in this situation, and the father of my child did a financial abortion, I wouldn\\'t even want him to be able to see him. Not only just not have parental rights... I don\\'t even think being able to go to soccer games and lunch dates would be fair.  Exactly, and none have to pay child support until it\\'s a child with rights, I don\\'t see the problem.    If you were being demanded to pay child support during pregnancy you\\'d have a point. Ireland isn\\'t a counter-example because I wasn\\'t trying to say that legal abortion is universal in developed nations, I was trying to say that the initial discussion was basically confined to those developed nations which have legal abortion.  You took \"fundamentally\" to apply to \"countries\" rather than \"legal,\" interpreting it as \"developed nations, fundamentally, have legal abortion\" rather than \"we\\'re talking about the subset of developed nations in which abortion is fundamentally legal.\"  It\\'s just a failure in communication, that\\'s all. >I think the point is that abortion and adoption are two very extended, complicated, and possibly painful and traumatic experiences  Not to be blunt, but you\\'re exaggerating.  No, abortion and adoption aren\\'t painless, but neither is the decision to legally step away from a child.  For all intents and purposes, a man using some form of legal abortion is undergoing the *exact same process* as one who (with his partner) decides to place a child for adoption; the only difference is that the resulting child is \"adopted\" by the biological mother (should she herself choose neither abortion nor adoption) rather than an unrelated party.

However,  judges, unless complete idiots,  would never grant custody, even partial,  to a rapist.   Many states do have specific laws revoking custody from rapists.  However I\\'m pretty sure those require a conviction.   Though frankly, as the law sits,  they\\'re not a rapist if not found guilty.     The problems with custody and child support involving \"rape\" where the offender is granted parental rights of support or custody,  isn\\'t actual rape but statutory rape,  these cases are under a slightly different color of law,  as the offender and victim are not necessarily risk laden when it comes to the welfare of the child.  Even though if convicted they\\'d likely dissolve any parental rights anyhow.   Ultimately this particular matter isn\\'t one of regular concern,  or even of minor concern.   At very worst,  the rape victim will have to fight the custody in court, which can be a pain in the ass,  plus a traumatic bit considering their rapist is the plaintiff.   But to be actually awarded custody for their efforts,  I\\'m not sure a case as such even exists in the US (statutory rape excluded) and if it does, it\\'s exceedingly rare.   Which is wrong in itself - the state should IMHO stay out of this (note: I live in Germany and the state throws money at parents like there\\'s no tomorrow - quite disgusting IMHO)...I don\\'t think a declining population is a bad thing (less damage to the environment is one huge benefit!), as long as you can compensate (automation is one thing that can work wounders here - there\\'s lot of jobs that people hold ATM that could easily be done by machines!) or do without, it\\'s not going to hurt a country if there\\'s a few million people less IMHO!  ps: Funnily enough, Germany is more liberal than the US, but I don\\'t think this would go over well here either (women still think they are the disadvantaged gender (even if that is no longer true - hell, they get more university degrees than men do, they live longer etc.) - and milk that for what it\\'s worth, so they would rally against that (and a lot of pussy-whipped men would follow them, too)) Okay I see where you are coming from. I\\'m not going to discuss rape cases or deception right now because I do think those would warrant an exception. I do want to address the part where you say \"It is unjust for the law to force men to pay for kids they never wanted\". I have to disagree here.  Who else has the responsibility to support the child if not the father, the man who brought that child into the world in the first place? What would be more \"just\" in your opinion? Making taxpayers pay for someone else\\'s mistake? Just making the mother support the child alone and letting them live in poverty?  I agree that making the man help support his child might not be convenient for him, but it is certainly justifiable and makes perfect sense in my opinion. Can be, however the disparity in award v. economic position between males and females is very distinct.    For exactly the same reason that the taxes of those who opt not to have children still go to pay for schools. The state never pays for anything.  Taxpayers pay for everything.  The state only has to decide if the taxpayers should pay for it, then decide if they pay for it with increased tax revenue or increased generational debt. Whatever it is called, the concept that people are talking about doesn\\'t change.  I am in favour of abortion whether it is called abortion or fetus killing, because both terms refer to the same actual outcome. Likewise, I support financial abortion regardless what it was called.   I have seen research stating that using different terms for the same concept make people more or less likely to support said concept, but those people are irrational and should be dismissed.  Women could have that choice if the father wants to take sole custody but thats just one scenario. Why not? - Because he is a man and she\\'s a woman?...come on, that sexist feminist BS -.- Why would that be any different from an adopted child trying to find their biological parents? Biology is unequal. That is why a woman can force a man to be a biological father against his consent (even if financial abortion was legal), while a man cannot do the same.   But that is irrelevant, since we are not talking about biology.  We are talking about the law.  It is unjust for the law to force men to pay for kids they never wanted.  It is unjust for the law to force men to pay for kids when they were raped.  It is unjust for the law to force **boys** to pay for kids when they were raped.  It is unjust for the law to force men to pay for kids that resulted by deliberate deception.  The law must be just. And that is why financial abortion should be legal. Mom may not know with an adopted child. Mom has a decent chance of knowing who got her pregnant. He would presumably still be on the hook for the abortion and adoption processes, at least financially even if nothing else. The implication that he would necessarily be able to just walk away the morning after is false, they are both responsible for the pregnancy.  Assuming he does not want a child, we could have it so that it would not be until after one of these things has been completed that his obligations would be done:  1. The woman has opted for *and completed* an abortion.  2. The woman has opted for adoption, *has carried the baby to term, and the adoption is complete.*  3. The woman has opted to keep and raise the baby *and has carried the baby to term.*  Note that there is also no reason why a woman might not opt out as well, yet carry to term and let the baby be raised by the man if she doesn\\'t want to and he does. Both are fully responsible for the pregnancy, and both have equal rights after birth.  Of course, they would need to make these commitments, legally speaking, long before the baby was actually carried to term. Well it\\'s not a case of playing draw, but more to the point:    - once conceptions occurs, she is either pregnant for 9 months or has to go through a medical abortion procedure.  She can\\'t just \"wish it hadn\\'t happened\" and sign a paper and walk out.   - both pregnancy and abortion are psychological as well as physical burdens.   - if the child is born, she can\\'t opt out of child support.    The only choice the female has that the male does not is pregnancy vs. abortion ONLY because pregnancy happens in her body.  A female cannot choose on another woman\\'s body nor can the female choose that the male be pregnant instead.   > No, she doesn\\'t. She has the option of abortion long before the pregnancy begins to cause any significant issues for her.  Abortion is not always an available option for women. And even when it is, *abortion affects a woman in ways that it does not and can not affect men*. Agreed, but by that logic, both should be held responsible because the pregnancy was a result of both parties\\' actions.  The problem arises when only one has a say in the matter.  Edit: Otherwise, you\\'d either have to argue that women are entirely responsible for what happens to their bodies (and men aren\\'t responsible for what they do to them), thus allowing men to financially abort, or that men are entirely responsible for what they do to women\\'s bodies (and women aren\\'t responsible for what happens to theirs), giving them no decision.  Each of those options operate on a complete lack of agency on one side, making it difficult to find a middle ground when both parties are held accountable for their actions. Supporting a child is not the outcome of sex. People keep saying it in this thread, and it is 100% false.  It is the outcome of a woman choosing to birth and raise a child. Not \"developed nations, where abortion is fundamentally legal,\" \"developed nations where abortion is fundamentally legal.\"  That is, nations which are both developed (so they have at least the basic means to offer easily-accessible abortion) *and* have fundamentally legal abortion. Plan B and RU 486 are not traumatic.  ...that\\'s the situation we have now for families that are in the income bracket where spousal support would actually be needed. Here\\'s what I don\\'t get--everybody is saying that the woman can willy nilly put the child up for adoption--but don\\'t both parents need to relinquish their parental rights for that to happen? >Having consenting sex with a person of the opposite gender is consent to be a parent, period. Would it be incredibly wrong to intentionally deceive someone about birth control? Yes. However, even if there is deception going on **no** birth control aside from total removal of reproductive organs is 100% effective and pregnancy is a known outcome of sex.  I disagree with this bit. Sex is mostly a recreational activity for many. It\\'s like saying that is you drive, that\\'s consent to die in an accident. Sure, you know the risk of it happening, but that doesn\\'t really change anything. Yes, because if there is anything our society needs, it is less individual accountability. I\\'m sorry, but I\\'d rather just be responsible for my own choices and not have to pay extra money to support other peoples\\' 100% avoidable mistakes.   > The father is permitted to financially abort, but loses any right to see the child (something similar to a restraining order).  Was this in any doubt?   A financial abortion would mean eliminating all parental rights. Just as people who adopt out their kids lose parental rights.  It would make no sense for someone who enacts financial abortion to have any parental rights whatsoever. Supporting a child is not a contract, it\\'s the outcome of voluntary sex which you risk knowingly. While I agree that those two things are not equal nor fair, neither is the father\\'s lack of choice over whether the child is carried to term.  Everyone pulls on the heart strings when talking about mothers who want to have babies, but if the same mother doesn\\'t want the child but the father does, the mother\\'s choice wins.  That\\'s not fair either.  While it\\'s impossible to make this whole uncomfortable situation fully fair for everyone, a man being able to financially dissolve his ties to the child (with, perhaps, some compensatory requirement to attempt to legally make up the difference you rightly bring up) is far more fair than the current situation where a woman\\'s choice to have or not have a baby has decades of financial consequences for the father that he has no control over. >I believe the current law would be on those men\\'s side if they could prove it.   No, it is not. Even in cases of statutory rape - where the law is certain that the boy could not consent - the male is forced to pay.  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/  Even in cases of actual rape, judges have ruled that even if the man was raped does not eliminate child support obligations:   http://www.supportguidelines.com/articles/art199903.html  >The father argued that because he did not have sex voluntarily with the mother, he was not liable for child support. The court disposed of the argument, comparing it to the arguments made in L. Pamela P. v. Frank S.: the wrongful conduct of the mother in causing conception did not obviate the father\\'s support obligation. The court also compared the father\\'s argument to the arguments put forth in the statutory rape cases, concluding that the \"rape\" of the father could not preclude a finding of liability for support. Well, to be honest, I feel like by opting out of child support, but by getting to see the child, he\\'s getting all of the benefits (watching kid grow up, offer friendly advice, hang out), along with none of the responsibility (cost, sacrifice of time [when he doesn\\'t want to]/energy, being the bad guy about keeping the kid out of trouble, etc).   It\\'s hard for me to explain, and understand, myself... Because I feel like if I did adopt a child, I wouldn\\'t mind the bio-parents stopping by every once in awhile.   I guess it\\'s kinda like the difference of how you know someone. The scenario between these two, at least in my head, is:   - I\\'m dating a guy for awhile, I accidentally get pregnant, for some reason I decide not to have an abortion, and he is like \"Sorry, even though I said I love you before, we can\\'t do this together. You\\'re on your own, I\\'m outta here! This is the best choice for me.\"  - With adoption, both bio-parents are saying \"We can\\'t do this together. This is best choice for us and the baby.\"   I guess adoption feels less personal.  >Giving men the option to financially abort basically means you rid them of all responsibility towards the woman they impregnated and the child they created.  ...  >How is it fair to give men the option to escape any and all responsibilities associated with a pregnancy when we can\\'t give women that same choice?  What would you say to the argument that the man should be financially responsible for a fair proportion of the extra expenses that arise due to the pregnancy, but could still be off the hook after the child is born?  And to keep things simple, we\\'ll assume that the woman knew that the man didn\\'t want a child before they had sex, that he took reasonable precautions against it happening, and that he had no reason to believe that the woman would keep the baby if she did get pregnant.  There doesn\\'t even need to be any deception - she could have just changed her mind after she was pregnant.  Basically this is something that she wants, something that he didn\\'t want, something that she knew he didn\\'t want, and something that he had no idea  she wanted.  That way there\\'s at best a *very* weak argument that the man tacitly agreed to being financially liable for the child\\'s lifetime. Not exactly. It depends on the state. Boys who have been the victim of statutory rape have had to pay child support. Given birth records for both the boy, the assailant, and the child that came as a result of that rape it is relatively easy to prove that a crime was committed.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermesmann_v._Seyer   > Women are only not financially responsible if there is no named father. If the father isn\\'t named, he\\'s not on the hook for child support either, so it doesn\\'t matter.  But it does matter.  Due to biology, and biased laws, a woman may do this to avoid parental obligations. She may deliberately not name the father, even if she knows who it is.  A man cannot do this.  Which in practice leads to this:  http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/55354372-78/shaud-court-adoption-utah.html.csp It wouldn\\'t be hard to force the man who is aborting to have to fill out some paperwork to monitor how many times a man has done this.  You do realise I was not saying how great financial abortion is. I was simply showing a way for the government to track each case, not to mention like most people said they father would receive no visitation rights unless he paid for the child.  The problem is women are given the power to waive the responsibility to provide those rights. So why shouldn\\'t men be given equal power? Of course, that doesn\\'t do anything about all the money you\\'ve sunk in before you can even do that.  Having a kid often isn\\'t cheap. This assumes that we don\\'t structure things around it. As a male, I would gladly pay a \"potential father tax\" or \"potential father insurance\" so that in the event that somebody I have sex with becomes pregnant, I don\\'t have to pay anything. We could have such a system in place for everybody and the woman and child aren\\'t \"punished\" by the father opting out, they just draw from a fund specifically set up for such a situation. This is even more fair than our current reality, since children of rich parents get more funding than children of poor fathers. > Unless we\\'re talking about rape (which is another matter altogether, and we probably all agree a rapist gives up most of their rights)  Unfortunately this isn\\'t true. Women who get pregnant as a result from a rape are not guaranteed to be able to keep the rapist from getting some, or all, custody of the child. And men who are raped that directly results in a child being conceived can be on the hook for child support. It\\'s messed up on all sides. This could most definitely happen in a more liberal society, especially if they are struggling with an inadequate birth rate. A lot of European countries give tons of government benefits to parents with children. As birth rates in the developed world continue to drop more and more government policies will be geared toward family matters. I think it has more saying that if two people get in a situation together that is unfavorable, then we shouldn\\'t be setting up a system that allows one person to run away from the problem while the other person gets the short end of the stick regardless. If you helped create the problem, you have to deal with it, too. > Bradley Amendment  Although the Bradley Amendment is a poorly written piece of legislation (IMO it\\'s unconstitutional) it\\'s not a rebuttal to the judicial force issue.   The Bradley Amendment basically makes failure to pay a federal criminal matter in a similar manner as contempt of court. As such, it very much IS in the criminal sphere. It specifically overrides contract and civil law, which would not allow many of the injustices caused by it.  The purpose behind the legislation is noble, which is usually what creates the worst laws. Everyone is in such a hurry to be seen to be doing the right thing they don\\'t bother checking to see if they are inadvertently doing some wrong or stupid things. We also saw this with the patriot act, many child protection acts, and acts intended to allow the police to do their jobs properly. 1111 Once conception occurs by concensual and knowledgeable sexual intercourse, both lose some measure of control of their situation. As a society we tend to feel that the mother should be compensated/supported somehow. My preference would be for the state to offer the support. More conservative viewpoints consider the responsibility should lay with the father. Not acceptable =/= not preferable, and sometimes the state has an interest in the latter as well.   I get what you\\'re saying, but there\\'s no reason that a law couldn\\'t distinguish between situations like those you mention. It\\'s not such a reductio ad absurdum in reality. Not necessarily.  [According to the most recent data, 62 percent of women in the United States who gave birth in a one-year period also worked during that time.](http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/workplace-fairness/pregnancy-discrimination/pregnant-workers-need-pregnant-workers-fairness-act.pdf)  The problem is that both parties are held equally accountable for the consequences of their actions, but only women get to determine those responsibilities (because they\\'re physically pregnant), even though that decision will affect both parties.  Broken down, one argument says, \"It\\'s unfortunate that you\\'re the one who happens to get pregnant, but we\\'re both equally responsible for our actions and therefore have earned an equal say in the matter because it will affect both of us.\"  The other says, \"We\\'re both equally responsible for our actions, but you voided your right to determine those responsibilities upon having sex because I\\'m the one who happens to get pregnant.\"  I\\'m trying to play devil\\'s advocate for both sides, but it\\'s like placing a monetary value on the physical burden of pregnancy.  If humans mated like fish, we\\'d have an equal say in the matter, but like you said, abortion gives a woman autonomy over her body, even though the man is affected as well.  Also, pregnancy lasts for 9 months while supporting a child takes much longer; there are numerous factors to consider.  Similar to what I mentioned earlier, I imagine that the only possible \"fair\" solution in an \"unfair\" situation would require a compromise from each involved party. So, where did they think babies came from before the word \"abort\" existed? Of course there is - at least in western society: ABORTION (women have access to the button - men don\\'t, so it\\'s not fair...hell, it\\'s like the opposite outcome: making abortion no longer available - women would be forced to carry the baby to term - now I think you would say that\\'s not fair, so why is it fair to practically enslave (for lack of a better term) the man to pay child-support even if he didn\\'t want the child to be born, while it is not fair to force the woman to carry the child to term? - I agree that men should not be able to do this (force the woman to stay pregnant), but women should not be able to enslave men either!)  ps: yes it\\'s a medical procedure, but a lot of that psychological BS is something society makes women who have one go through (I know women who have had one without telling anyone and they are fine!)...there may be some who suffer - but making it out like every women has problems after one isn\\'t right! I dunno, If I can\\'t even have kids, why should I have to pay a father\\'s tax, it may seem selfish but that\\'s how I see it. The state never pays for anything.  Taxpayers pay for everything. Women can and are ordered to pay child support, if the circumstances are appropriate. This is where the confusion is. The money is not for the mother. It\\'s for the child. And he child is an innocent third party between the man and the woman. The child will suffer if financial aid is cut. And it\\'s for that reason that fathers do not have the option to financial severe themselves.  Okay. I\\'m just saying that I think that such a system would be riddled with loopholes and easy outs, while placing the burden of upholding the law on women. Okay, and what about the delivery?  Our last was a little over 10k (after insurance).  But the point isn\\'t exactly \"hey, you forgot one expense\" but that there are a lot of different expenses and they add up. I\\'m sorry for instigating the long comment. I\\'m not trying to flame you, I\\'m trying to argue against your argument. Someone brought up contract law and you stated that breaking a contract will make someone responsible for compensation. My argument was simply that the compensation analogy is a bad foot to stand on, as you might agree since you said drawing an analogy between contract law and abortion is a poor choice.   If people started assuming what obligations fall under sex, we might not have legal abortions now. A common argument against abortion was that women decided to take on their responsibilities as an adult when they had sex, and it certainly isn\\'t the fetus\\' fault that it\\'s alive. It doesn\\'t choose to attach itself, it\\'s forced there by it\\'s parents. The law supported this idea for a very long time, and it was eventually changed by long debates and spreading information to gain support.  This debate is similar. The current law should be changed if it is considered unfit by a large portion of the population. At least, a large enough portion to consider a compromise. I\\'m not trying to evade the law, I\\'m trying to keep the law from making assumptions about my obligations after I\\'ve consented to sex, which is a similar thinking to what led to legalizing abortions. This debate supports opening the law to more freedom and less responsibility.  Naturally, you get people who support freedom for themselves and people who support responsibility for others, especially when there is something to gain. I get flustered by these debates when I see \"Men entered the contract and must assume responsibility.\" used when the same was not considered true of women, and was even considered an irrational, misogynistic argument. I get really bothered by the \"Biology is unfair, get over it.\" argument because that was a very central attack on women not very long ago. These kinds of arguments support giving up on the search for a better approach since, as you stated, the best we can do is choose between two evils.  I suggest that, if we\\'ve already shown that the arguments used against abortion have no basis in reasoning, we should not use the same arguments to justify an unchanging law. Instead, we should be finding a much deeper understanding of how to sort out the responsibilities of being an adult in the most unbiased way possible so that oppression/sexism/whatever else can be written out of federal laws.  Did you ever look up the possible psychological or physical effects of it? I would be a relevant statement, if your ex said it was \"easy peasy\". This might be the case for some women, but absolutely not all women. Of course it is \"easy peasy\" to you, because you had no consequences.  The child is the outcome of the mother\\'s decision not to abort.  Child support is NOT the outcome of sex. It is a man made law that can and should be changed. Financial responsibility goes beyond childbirth. Childbirth is only 9 months out of an 18-21 year obligation. I don\\'t think it\\'s a good enough reason to have such a skewed difference in rights. >No matter what, a woman will always be affected by a pregnancy in ways a man isn\\'t. She has to carry the child, which is a huge physical and emotional toll. A man does not. This is unfair, but it\\'s the way nature works and we cannot change this.  One day they\\'re going to invent an artificial womb.  But until that day, procreation can never be equal. They actually do have that choice.    Consenting to the risk of the outcome is not the same as consenting to the outcome. If I\\'m walking near a street and someone hits me with a car, the fact that I knew the risks by walking near the street doesn\\'t change anything. That doesn\\'t mean I owe the driver anything because I knew the risks. I think the point is that abortion and adoption are two very extended, complicated, and possibly painful and traumatic experiences, while the dudes option of saying \"im not paying\" is pretty easy.  9 guity ;) I\\'m not saying it\\'s the same, but a man saying \"I\\'m not paying\" isn\\'t necessarily easy. He still has to live with the fact that there\\'s a child out there, who he created, who\\'s growing up without a father and without proper financial assistance.  I know, it\\'s not at all the same as the emotional weight of having an abortion, but it\\'s not *easy.* Not for everyone. (But then, for some women having an abortion is emotionally easy) >Women don\\'t just create babies on their own. You do understand this, right?  Yes. But only women have the choice to create a child. Whether or not a child is born is solely a woman\\'s choice.  >I also just want to highlight the seemingly obvious fact that the decision to have an abortion isn\\'t like choosing ham on wheat vs. turkey on white....  No one said it was.   >Bottom line... If you don\\'t know your partner\\'s stance on abortion or what they would want the outcome of an unexpected pregnancy to be, DON\\'T FUCK THEM!!   Except even a man who does everything he is supposed to can be forced into parenthood.   Take a man who discusses kids before having sex, and he only has sex within committed relationships, with women who agree they don\\'t want kids. And he makes sure that birth control is used.  If a woman pokes holes in the condoms and/or lies about being on birth control, he will still be forced to pay.  And that is of course 100% legal. Would you support a law that penalized pregnant women who failed to undergo abortion if their partner died early into their pregnancy, or pregnant women who failed to undergo abortion when their partner was known to be inaccessible for the purposes of child support?  Unless you support that statement in its entirety, you\\'re accepting that it is morally and legally acceptable for someone to bring a child into the world with the understanding that the child will not have the resources and benefits associated with having two parents.  Given that this is acceptable, it\\'s illogical to accept that a mother is not free to make the same choice in a case where the father is theoretically available but has preemptively disowned the child; in doing so, you must by nature validate the father\\'s decision to do so.  To illustrate the point, if you accepted the first statement as true, you would have to accept that a woman who failed to undergo abortion despite the knowledge that her male partner would be unavailable to provide support for the child (regardless of why) would *herself* be engaging in an act that should rightly be punishable by law.  The wording\\'s convoluted, I know, so it may take a couple tries, but it does make sense.  (I\\'m not calling you stupid, I\\'m calling my wording awkward.)  Basically, either it\\'s acceptable for someone to unilaterally decide that a child will come into the world with only one parent or it isn\\'t.  If it isn\\'t, you have to throw the book at not just voluntary single mothers, but widows as well.  If it is, that decision cannot be meaningfully divided by gender, especially because a woman has the option of abortion in response to such a decision by her partner.  Justice is allowing both men and women to make an affirmative choice whether to become parents based on the limitations implied by their biology.  There is no justice in allowing women the right to abortion while holding men legally responsible for a decision they had no part in making.  I know I\\'m not being particularly eloquent here, but from where I\\'m standing this should pretty much be a no-brainer. I think how bad that is depends on the state. In California, if there\\'s any dispute whatsoever, the parties run the numbers in a computer program called the [Dissomaster](http://www.childsupportca.com/dissomaster.htm). Dissomaster couldn\\'t give a rat\\'s ass what your genitalia look like. There\\'s even an [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cflr-dissomaster/id467108693?mt=8) for that. >Giving men the option to financially abort basically means you rid them of all responsibility towards the woman they impregnated and the child they created. Women do not have the option to do this. They cannot sign a paper and have the baby just disappear. They have to go through an invasive medical procedure in order to do it.  This is a nice idea, but how about saying that a man can only have a financial abortion if he agrees not only to give up all rights to the child, but also if he gets himself permanently sterilized? It is an invasive medical procedure, and furthermore it guarantees that unless the guy cares to go through another invasive procedure to reverse it, he\\'s not going to be making that mistake again? Men have no obligation for child support until after the baby is born.  Women can put a baby up for adoption the minute it is born. > Unless you support that statement in its entirety, you\\'re accepting that it is morally and legally acceptable for someone to bring a child into the world with the understanding that the child will not have the resources and benefits associated with having two parents.  Not necessarily- this would be akin to a parent dying after the child was born and the mother not immediately giving the child up for adoption because there would no longer have the same resources and benefits associated with having two parents. >If a woman gets pregnant, and doesn\\'t want to be a biological parent, she may abort. Or she may choose not to abort, but it is her choice and only her choice. That is due to biology.  Or put the child up for adoption or leave the child with the father.    That\\'s not the argument. The argument is that you cannot equate a financial abortion to a real abortion. It\\'s a counter to the argument that it\\'s only \"fair\" to allow a man to financially abort if women can physically abort, because those things are not \"fair\" or equal in any way.  Yes, and if the father wants to raise the child, the woman should not be forced to pay child support.  > When you argue that financial abortion is a way of making things \"fair\" to men, you are ignoring the fact that women can\\'t ever have an equivalent option. How is it fair to give men the option to escape any and all responsibilities associated with a pregnancy when we can\\'t give women that same choice?  Women should also have the same choice. >Abortion is not always an available option for women.   The number of women for whom abortion is not a *medical* option is very small.  The availability of abortion as a *practical* option (due to cost or location issues, for example) is an issue of execution rather than morality or legality.  The solution to issues with abortion availability is not arbitrarily depriving all men of reproductive autonomy, it\\'s fixing issues related to abortion availability.  >And even when it is, abortion affects a woman in ways that it does not and can not affect men.  Absolutely, but what does this have to do with the argument or point at hand?  Fundamentally, the existence of abortion means that women do *not* necessarily have to carry a pregnancy to term, let alone give birth and then take legal/financial responsibility for the resulting child.  Which are closer, abortion and legal/paper/financial abortion or abortion and forced legal/biological parenthood?  It isn\\'t really a complicated question, and as far as legal fairness (and justice, for that matter) are concerned it makes sense for us to opt for the more analogous of the two. But to whom is the control lost?  The parents, losing control, would be compelled by someone or something to support the baby, whether they want it or not.  If this something is basic ethics, would the ones that enforce morality (i.e the People) be given control? The state has only what taxpayers give them. If what you\\'re proposing is to spread out the responsibility and minimize the financial impact over *everyone*,literally, then I agree. >It\\'s to try to make their unfair situation a little more fair to them.  I\\'m not sure the word \"fair\" is to be used in this context. I think what you\\'re trying to say is \"compensation\". It is not necessarily fair, at least definitely not for the biological father, whose finance is being stripped from him in a situation where he has no control. But having sex doesn\\'t enter you into a binding contract, even consensual sex. And a man isn\\'t contractually bound to compensate for an agreement he never made.  You\\'ve got good points, but I don\\'t think they\\'re in favor of financial aid, rather I think it supports freedom from it under non-contractual sex. > Who else has the responsibility to support the child if not the father, the man who brought that child into the world in the first place?  But the woman is the one who brought the child into the world. It is her choice, and only her choice, that is responsible for that. If she didn\\'t want to birth the child, then she has the choice to abort regardless of the father\\'s wishes.  >Who else has the responsibility to support the child if not the father, the man who brought that child into the world in the first place? What would be more \"just\" in your opinion? Making taxpayers pay for someone else\\'s mistake? Just making the mother support the child alone and letting them live in poverty?  I think that raising taxes to improve the social safety net would be more just than the current system. Although he must endure financial hardship through work.  You can\\'t draw a specific parallel between each burden, but that doesn\\'t completely negate one of them. Huge difference, in the case of being hit by the car, you are the victim because it\\'s you right being infringed (unless the hit was your fault).  In the case of a child it\\'s their right to support that would be infringed if you walk out on it.    The outcome you are risking when having sex is a human being born, and no matter how you rephrase it, you are not the victim here.   > The child is the outcome of the mother\\'s decision not to abort.    It\\'s no more an outcome of the mother not aborting than it is of the father not murdering them both.  You seem to be unfamiliar with how human reproduction works.  All humans have two parents, not one \"unabortive\" one.    Child support reflects a parent\\'s responsibility and is a law like many others that regulate our life in community.   > Even in cases of actual rape, judges have ruled that even if the man was raped does not eliminate child support obligations:  It would seem, then, that child support laws\\' first objective is to care for the wellbeing of the child, not the parents. That\\'s probably part of why there\\'s a discrepancy between the woman being allowed to abort and the man not being able to give up financial responsibility - the woman is aborting something that is still a part of her body, ergo not a socially independent entity, whereas the man is \"aborting\" a new member of society, a real person. That carries many more problems for society, which now has to care for this real person by providing the education, healthcare, housing, etc that its birth father refused it. Conversely, only the biological mother has to care for her foetus (outside of any state abortion funding, which may be in place because it\\'s cheaper to pay for abortions than to pay for unwanted babies). If that is indeed the rationale, then I don\\'t see financial abortion ever becoming a thing. I\\'m pulling this together from my background knowledge only, but considering that most of developed countries\\' birth rate comes from the lower classes, where alimony payments would be a strain on the father (add class-specific issues with marriage rates and parental abandonment rates, racial and ethnic specifics), giving fathers the option to give up their children financially would put an unconscionable strain on the state budget. Plus, so far I only see a pejorative effect on the already low birth rates of developed countries. Family law definitely needs reform in view of the advancing demographic crisis, but I don\\'t think this is necessarily it. > I get really bothered by the \"Biology is unfair, get over it.\" argument because that was a very central attack on women not very long ago.  An excellent counter argument! Fighting unfairness with more unfairness is the wrong approach, I think we can both agree on that.   Don\\'t worry, I don\\'t feel flamed at all and hope you don\\'t feel flamed either, it\\'s not my intent. One of the most important lessons in law school is that 2 smart, well meaning people can look at the exact same information and come to 2 different opinions as to what it means and what to do about it, and it\\'s entirely possible for both to be right (or at least, not wrong!).  Historically, women had it bad - real bad. I\\'ve read a lot of court cases and they are enough to make anyone from the modern era really mad. That\\'s a problem of course, because in correcting a legitimately bad circumstance, another bad circumstance was created.   >Instead, we should be finding a much deeper understanding of how to sort out the responsibilities of being an adult in the most unbiased way possible so that oppression/sexism/whatever else can be written out of federal laws.   Agreed. Just because something is messy doesn\\'t mean we should just give up and accept it. ∆  I will say that in most cases, rape does not apply, simply that the father never wanted the child. But women have far too much control. Women don\\'t just create babies on their own. You do understand this, right?  I also just want to highlight the seemingly obvious fact that the decision to have an abortion isn\\'t like choosing ham on wheat vs. turkey on white. Deciding to have an abortion is choosing to have an invasive medical (and potentially life threatening) procedure. There is often a rather large emotional aspect involved as well.   You act as if there is some magic button women can press that says yay baby or nay baby. And that the choice is based on how badly they want to fuck you over. Perhaps she doesn\\'t want a child anymore than you do, but it isn\\'t so simple for the one carrying the kid. The potential father could run away from the issue; the potential mother is forced to deal with it in one way or another.   Bottom line... If you don\\'t know your partner\\'s stance on abortion or what they would want the outcome of an unexpected pregnancy to be, DON\\'T FUCK THEM!!   I understand that sex is awesome, but avoiding these situations just seems simple to me.  >She can have an abortion or out the child up for adoption. There is obviously a cost and toll for those options as well, but she does have a choice.  Also of note is that the cost and toll of raising a child is quite high. Children are not only very expensive (and lack of funds is a major cause of stress), but also stressful (young children are a lot of work to look after). I would argue that the cost and toll of abortion or adoption is negligible compared to the cost and toll of raising the child (ESPECIALLY if your finances are bad enough to require child support -- bear in mind child support is supposed to be to ensure that the parent has enough income to support the child and nothing more).  Also of note is that in the early stages of pregnancy, abortion is usually quite easy. You take a pill that might cause some cramps for a few hours, at worst (obviously I\\'m referring to the usual case -- unusual edge cases are possible for any medical procedure). And that\\'s basically it. So for the majority of people, abortion would be easier and less painful than carrying the child to term. I could see it happening in a more liberal society. I don\\'t think it could (our even should) without a lot more reforms to how pregnancy is treated in the US.  Biological parents are not legally forced to avoid their adopted-out children. I see no reason why someone who does financial abortion should be treated differently.   Can you elaborate as to why there is a justified difference? What if financial abortion required a vasectomy?  Would you consider it fair then since a man would have to undergo an invasive procedure in order to avoid the responsibility? You begin by saying that the situation can never be made fair, and continue by saying that something should continue because it helps make something fair.   Life is unfair yes, but it\\'s not the job of parents to break the toys of one child when the other breaks their own.  i think the way this would be structured is a bit more complex. there are various scenarios that can go down.   1. women wants child. man wants child = no abortion (duh) 2. women wants child. man doesn\\'t want child = no abortion 3. women doesn\\'t want child. man wants child = abortion 4. women doesn\\'t want child. man doesn\\'t want child = abortion (duh)  case and 1 and 4 are irrelevant, we are talking about situations where there is a dispute, so these are obviously not a concern for this discussion.   In case 2 I would argue that if the women goes ahead with keeping a child that the man specifically DOESNT want, the man should be clear of any financial responsibility. Some other people have argued that the situation for women is unfair because they actually have to carry the child and the biology of the situation. That\\'s assuming they waited to have the child. If a woman goes through with an entire pregnancy and doesn\\'t abort her child then SHE made the decision to have that child, not the man. Women know the outcome of sex just as much as men, sometimes they result in babies, why a man has to pay for a child he doesnt want doesnt make sense to me. We havent even discussed the very real situation in many households where the women are currently the breadwinners and make substantially more money than their S.O. Many women abuse this system and try to get pregnant with wealthy men in illegitimate situations to abuse this law. I would have to add though that the one reason i feel the status quo is fair is the fact that we have a lot of fucked up places in america where a poor disenfranchised women wont have adequate access to a safe abortion option, in that case the baby is coming whether you like it or not, and i do feel the guy has to cough up the cash in that sad and unfortunate situation.  Case 3 i feel is even more important. The emotional toll it would have to be in love with a women, hear that she has conceived your child, and then hear immediately that she doesnt feel like shes ready and wants to get rid of it, can be extremely traumatic for a lot of men. There was a story about it on relationships a while ago that just broke my heart. The girl basically told the dude (im paraphrasing) \"you\\'re a great guy, but im not exactly head over heels for you. i just dont feel that way and I\\'m going to take care of it.\" True, its only a collection of few generic cells, this isnt a pro life pro choice discussion, but that doesnt change the fact that a lot of guys view this as a very personal and damaging situation to be in. One that really haunts them for a long time, especially when it occurs in mature adult relationships later on in life.   Just thought to add my 0.02    Well, \"The State\" is the people who live there. No I don\\'t think it was, but it\\'s something to spell out. I\\'m primarily worried about what happens if the kid tries to find the father. That could get weird.  But to be fair, the alternative is carrying the child to term which can also affect the woman in ways that does not and cannot affect men. Also, adoption is an alternative that would involve the same degree of stress and pain as if you kept the child for yourself (although obviously not exactly the same since you go through all that stress and pain for nothing; since the child is given away).  Also of note is that early-pregnancy abortion is a very safe and practical for most women (of note is the regional differences -- in my area, abortion is freely available and doesn\\'t even require parental consent). The early-pregnancy options are arguably easier, safer, and less painful than carrying the child to term.  Admittedly, there\\'s the emotional issue as well, which I admit I do not really consider (this is a moral issue and I do not really have any attachment to unborn children). However, I see this as a trade off. You can have the child if you really want, but you can\\'t expect someone else to pay for them.  And it\\'s not like it\\'s the only moral issue where you have to make such kinds of trade offs. What if the father had died? You still have the same question of whether or not to raise the child, but this time you most certainly will not be getting child support (at least I don\\'t think you can get child support from the dead -- if so, change this hypothetical scenario to the father also being broke).  As an aside, if we\\'re going to consider the moral issue here, we should consider it the other way around, too. What if the mother doesn\\'t want the child but the father does? He\\'s not in a position to get the child (I don\\'t think any rational person would argue that the woman should be forced to carry the child to term). Yet, if he\\'s morally against abortion or similar, then he might be affected by the abortion in ways that the woman does not! Since there are medical reasons against abortion, ones that put the mother in danger.  What if, instead of paying for the child, the father pays **only** for the operation if the mother doesn\\'t want to abort. Then, if the mother doesn\\'t want to give up the baby for adoption, it would be **her choice**, and it wouldn\\'t (and *shouldn\\'t*) affect the father beyond the decisions he\\'s made. >But you cannot force someone to use their body to do something they don\\'t want to do in the non-criminal sphere.   Yeah?  Look up the Bradley Amendment. A father who gets laid off can\\'t get his CS obligations reduced and will be thrown into jail.  >No matter what, a woman will always be affected by a pregnancy in ways a man isn\\'t. She has to carry the child...  No, she doesn\\'t.  She has the option of abortion long before the pregnancy begins to cause any significant issues for her.  >Women do not have the option to do this. They cannot sign a paper and have the baby just disappear. They have to go through an invasive medical procedure in order to do it.  Early-stage abortions are a pill, not a medical procedure, and that\\'s ignoring emergency contraception as an option.  In many countries (Canada, for example), abortion costs are even covered by default.  Would you object to a male option which involved a payment equal to roughly half the cost of an abortion plus a nominal amount for the inconvenience suffered by women?  >When you argue that financial abortion is a way of making things \"fair\" to men, you are ignoring the fact that women can\\'t ever have an equivalent option.  Men cannot ever have an equivalent to abortion without abrogating women\\'s bodily integrity rights.  How do you suggest that be resolved on a legal level without infringing on those rights?  >But I think the problem is, you are trying to make a fair situation out of something that can never be fair.  The biological differences inherent in issues of parenthood mean that things can never be precisely *equal*, but that does not mean that legal measures cannot be implemented to make the situation relatively *fair*.  At the very least, legal measures can be implemented that would make the current situation vastly fairer than it *is*, making most counterarguments examples of the nirvana fallacy. I\\'m not too familiar how adoption law works.... If you give a baby up for adoption, are you ever allowed to change your mind?   What if the bio-father does the financial abortion, and then 10 years later wants to change his mind and be a part of the childs life?   Does he have to \"buy\" his way back in, in back child support? Does he just have to pay going forward? Does he have any leg to stand on if he sues? Does he need the mother\\'s explicit permission, or does the state get to say he is allowed back in?   Good point. Usually happens for existing children, though, since if a woman gets pregnant and doesn\\'t want the child, an abortion is entirely her choice and no court system can say otherwise (at least in my country).  In fact, I do not argue against child support for existing children; only for the case of an unborn child. >No one can be forced into a business deal against their will. If however, they sign a contract agreeing to, then the law will hold them to that agreement.  Untrue. There are lots of business agreements that are illegal even if everyone involved agrees to them. Suicide pacts and assassin for hire is just the tip of the iceburg. Prostitution is another. Any kind of forced labor or slavery is the third.If you agree to do work and then refuse to do it, the other guy is entitled to compensation, but they can\\'t expect a cop to come over and force you to dig that ditch at gunpoint just because you signed an agreement. You are also not allowed to sell your organs or kids. You can\\'t enter into a sale of goods for the purposes of tax evasion. I could go on and on. Lots of people have signed business agreements against their will. A LOT of landholders have been forced to sell their property due to developers forcing them to do so, for example.  >No one can be forced into employment against their will, that would be illegal. If however, they sign a contract agreeing to, the law will hold them to the terms of that agreement (assuming those terms are within the existing law).  Now this is a much more accurate statement. You should have skipped the first one in favor of this. It\\'s a much stronger point.  Here is the thing - the law does not consider money to be the same as physical labor. It hasn\\'t since the days when slavery was legal. You cannot force anyone to do something they don\\'t want to do under the law. You can force them to pay compensation, yes. Many people would rather do the work than pay the compensation, yes.  But you cannot force someone to use their body to do something they don\\'t want to do in the non-criminal sphere. Not in any first world country anyway. This includes giving birth or having an abortion.  A cop will not follow you on stage and force you to sing words, no matter how many lawyers Sony has. They won\\'t drag you into an abortion clinic against your will. All they will do is make sure you pay any compensation that a court orders for business agreements.  That\\'s one of the issues here - you cannot equate forcing someone to give birth to forcing someone to pay fees. Any attempt to do so will and should fail.  Now, there ARE ways to approach this problem where you are not putting personal freedom up against financial freedom, and instead pitting financial obligations of two parties against each other. These arguments are the ones to go with, and have more support within both the legal and legislative communities. You\\'re looking at it from a pregnancy/abortion perspective though. The key is what happens after pregnancy. I don\\'t think any men are fighting for the right to make a woman\\'s stomach not bloated. They are fighting for the option to not be attached to a child that is granted to women.   Let\\'s say a man and a woman have sex and the woman gets pregnant. If she doesn\\'t want to birth a child she can abort it, if she doesn\\'t want to have a child she can give it up for adoption; either way a year after the pregnancy it\\'s like it never happened, it\\'s just a memory with no implications on the present. The man in this situation has no options. If the woman aborts it, that was her right and the baby is gone, I don\\'t know of anyone who argues for forcing a woman to birth a baby. That point is not fought.   The key point is here though, what if the woman decides to keep the baby. The woman exercised her right to birth a baby and has chosen to keep it. The man had no say in the baby\\'s birth (which is fair) but ALSO has no choice in if the baby is kept. He is obligated to pay child support and has no option not to. The woman has the option to avoid parenthood with adoption services but the man gets his option picked for him by the woman\\'s choice. The woman\\'s choice decides if he pays child support for 18 years. >The child has a right to be supported by it\\'s parents  Only persons who consented to create the child are parents. Otherwise they are no more that sperm/egg donors, with neither responsibilities nor rights over the child. Because you still benefit. I don\\'t have kids but my taxes still pay for public schools. I like having educated people around me.  Same kind of idea. It would actually be roughly equivalent to both, your version just doesn\\'t happen to be relevant to the question at hand.  More specifically, the example would apply to any case where the deceased parent had not established some form of support in the event of their death.  (i.e. a large enough life insurance policy, survivor\\'s benefits/pension etc.)  Either way, you\\'re sidestepping the main point: if children have a \"right\" to the support of two parents, it\\'s reasonable to punish *any* parent who makes an affirmative decision to create or keep a child in a situation where the child will be deprived of that right.  This is ridiculous, of course, but if it isn\\'t true we basically have to accept that it is morally and legally acceptable for a parent to unilaterally place a child in a position where they will be deprived of one parent\\'s support.  If that\\'s true, it\\'s actually *easier* to justify the male equivalent from a moral perspective, since a man preemptively disclaiming parenthood is much more likely to lead to an abortion (and no child to be deprived of anything) than a woman voluntarily becoming a single parent (which effectively guarantees it).  It\\'s an unusual approach to the argument, but it\\'s not necessarily an invalid one. >If you give a baby up for adoption, are you ever allowed to change your mind?   If the adoption has just occurred, generally yes.   If it has been years? Then no, you have the same rights as a random stranger.  Bio-parents can make contact with their adopted-out children - and they often do - but they do not have parental rights.  >What if the bio-father does the financial abortion, and then 10 years later wants to change his mind and be a part of the childs life?   Then that is too bad. No different than a woman who adopted out her child but wants to be the ~~other~~ parent 10 years later.  Not to be rude, but these are not new, troubling questions that arise from financial abortion. They have already been examined and addressed a long time ago with adoption law.  > Aborting a fetus escapes any and all responsibilities that comes with the pregnancy.     Problem is,  the woman has 100% choice over this.  Which I\\'m all in agreement with.   However, let\\'s play a hypothetical.     A woman gets pregnant with a guy who has very low income but really wants a child.   He\\'d give all he has to care for it.   She aborts the child,  even though he\\'d have taken the child and care solely for it without any further need from her.    She later gets pregnant with a guy who doesn\\'t want children,  quite well off though.   She chooses not  to abort the child and the guy is on the hook for something he wants nothing to do with.      The problem is that beyond the 9 month period,  the woman is not ACTUALLY affected by the child if the father chose to care for the child, she put it up for adoption, or anything but CHOOSING to take care of the kid.  The father doesn\\'t have the option to choose.  The disparity is unwarranted and unfair.    If the unemployed father wanted custody of the child and wanted the employed mother to give him child support,  you\\'d find that very hard to run by the courts,   though it wouldn\\'t at all be troubling to have the courts order even an very low income father to pay child support.   If the man feels so bad about the baby living without financial aid, he could surely support the woman somehow. Somebody might say he might have no money, but he will surely have more money than a single woman with a child.   But really, I\\'d say the men, that profit most by that \"financial abortion\" as it was called before, are men who neither care about deseases and therefore not about proper contraception, who do not feel any empathy for a possible child. They don\\'t have to fear any consequences. Especially uneducated or irresponsible people will have more babies (and probably more abortions).  But so did the mother. Yet the biological father is forced to pay her for a choice she also made. What control the woman loses (assuming abortion is available)? Regarding the restraining order thing, I would think that would be unnecessary. Surely the kind of person who financially aborts has no interest in being a father.  A restraining order just create issues and complicates what would otherwise be a very simple process. For example, consider the case of someone who has sex with someone, financially aborts, and then in a few years, has children of his own. His children could end up going to the same school as the kid he has a restraining order against, which obviously causes issues.  Besides, what would we need a restraining order for? The guy is not a threat or anything. He just doesn\\'t want to pay for the kid. That\\'s not what restraining orders are for.  If the guy ends up being a crazy stalker, sure, get a restraining order then, but that\\'s completely unrelated from the fact that he financially aborted.  Of course, there\\'s the issue of when the father \"financially aborts\" but stays with the family (ie, just saying that he doesn\\'t want to pay child support if he ever leaves) which could be handled in the same way that we already do: child support is dependent on whether or not you support the child. It\\'s not automatically given and would have to be requested if either parent decides to stop supporting the child. And presumably if the family gets back together, the child support payments would stop. This requires a court system with some discretion, which seems like a challenge (okay, that was a bit snarky, but we can\\'t deny that the courts can be extremely inconsistent), but not unbelievable.  As an aside, a complete alternative could be to use basic income here. You may be familiar with that (if not, checkout /r/basicincome). It usually covers adults, but could easily cover children, too. The children\\'s pay could be given to the parents until they child becomes an adult and could be appropriately chosen so that it\\'s always enough to raise the child. I don\\'t consider people having many children to get money to be an issue since child support already exists and the basic income would only be enough to raise a child and not significantly such that you could become rich from it. This would be the most exploited insurance in the world. If abortion is legal that child has no rights until it can\\'t be aborted anymore. Which would involve the mother putting together paperwork, documenting the illegal visits with as much evidence as possible for proof- it would have to be multiple visits, for a strong case- and then most likely lawyering up to actually produce repercussions.   If the guy\\'s rich (and he\\'ll likely be better off than mom, seeing as he isn\\'t bringing up a kid), he may be able to line up a good defense attorney and maybe even win visitation rights to see the kid he wanted to abort.   The problem with this idea is that it places the burden on the mothers doorstep: first in taking care of the kid, and second in keeping the father away. All of this documenting, the court visits, and lawyer would cost women time, money, and effort to fight. Most people have enough difficulty investing their time, money, and effort in things that they *want* and are vital to *life*. Why make these ladies lives harder just to give men a \"get out of irresponsible sex free\" card?  Edit: I also want to clarify for you why women might decide to keep a kid even if they are in no way capable of raising one.   First off, there\\'s a huge societal pressure to not abort- some families will straight up disinherit/have nothing to do with their daughters if they do so.   Second, it\\'s not that easy to abort. In quite a few states, the doctors are legally required to do a little \"shaming speech\" about how far a long the kid is: whether or not the fetus will be able to feel pain, what features have developed, etc. This is an attempt to humanize the fetus, and make it feel more like murder.   Third is the access issue. Due to highly stringent regulations on facilities, in many states there are no more than a few facilities. This means that a woman has to drive several hours, or possibly fly to a different state, to get the procedure done. And I hope you realize that there would definitely have to be more than one visit before the abortion, and that the entire cost will be on the woman (insurers don\\'t have to cover abortions).  Fourth is the health issue. A lot of men seem to think that abortion is easy and easily accessible (it isn\\'t), without recognizing the potential health hazards for women. If it\\'s done wrong, women can be seriously hurt. They can also become sterile, even plan b can fuck with your body if you use it too often. It\\'s suggested to never take it more than twice.  And all of this ignores the massive potential for shaming on the way to a clinic: there are a number of facilities that bill themselves as abortion clinics, but in fact wait until the woman is vulnerable (re: undressed and in scrubs for their visit), and then verbally lambaste them for their choice. They can\\'t leave, because the facility is keeping their clothes hostage. Some women walk out without their clothes in public just to escape.  Then there are the protesters who are routinely in front of the real facilities. And then, there\\'s the fact that insurance providers also like to make birth control as hard as possible to get in the first place. When my sister recently went to pick up her birth control, they denied her first because she didn\\'t have her prescription card, even though she had her insurance card. Then, when she provided her prescription card, her insurance provider insisted on having written notice from her doctor for the prescription, even though the doctor called the prescription in to the pharmacy for her in the first place.  Women already have all of these shitty impositions, now you want to place another shitty imposition on women where they\\'re forced to be solely responsible for the kid? Do you guys really think women should universally be put between a rock and a hard place for all things related to sex?! Do men *want* to get laid?  And frankly, I see this as a choice. If you want the child, you need to support it yourself or have a *willing* partner. I would liken forcing an unwilling partner to pay for child support to economical rape. Some places allow the adopted child sccess to information about parents when they turn 18. I imagine it would be the same and would be as awkward as an adopted child except probably a lot more resentment towards the father >> That is why a woman can force a man to be a biological father against his consent (even if financial abortion was legal), **while a man cannot do the same.**  >Are you saying that a man cannot force a woman to be a biological mother against her consent? Because that\\'s very, very wrong in many ways.  Last I checked rape was illegal and abortion legal.  What are you getting at?  You are right.  In theory, that is the argument.  I don\\'t agree with that argument though. I think that removing women\\'s ability to force men to pay for kids they never wanted - even if the men were raped, or deliberately deceived - would be the best outcome for society. >Whoa whoa whoa... when has the law ever been about what people want?   Since the beginning of the law.  No one can be forced into a business deal against their will. If however, they sign a contract agreeing to, then the law will hold them to that agreement.  No one can be forced into employment against their will, that would be illegal. If however, they sign a contract agreeing to, the law will hold them to the terms of that agreement (assuming those terms are within the existing law).  >It\\'s unjust for the law not to force parents to care for the children that they have.  No, it is not.  Forcing a man who has been raped to pay is not just - it is unjust.  Forcing a man whose condoms were sabotaged to pay is not just - it is unjust.  >Justice is seeing to it that the child is cared for whether the parents want to or not.   Women are not forced to care for children, even if the child is birthed.  If a woman unilaterally decides to have a child against the consent of the father, it is not justice to force him to pay. Yes, it\\'d be a much bigger hassle... And where would this money come from, to take care of all these kids? I can already hear the righteous anger of taxpayers having to fund these slutty mothers\\' drinking/drug/gambling habits along with their bastard brats. Note that most of the flak will be on the mother in this situation, because the father is absent and virtually impossible to ID or point fingers at.  Not to mention that now that there\\'s virtually no repercussion for impregnating a woman (because there\\'s no way in *hell* the gov\\'t is all powerful enough to monitor the father\\'s every move), why not impregnate another woman? That\\'s why I clearly differentiated abortion availability as a medical option (whether a woman\\'s medical status allows her to safely undergo abortion) and abortion availability as a practical option (all the stuff you mentioned).  I never said that there weren\\'t serious issues with abortion availability, just that those are mostly issues of execution rather than moral/legal issues.  Also, looking at the last items on your list, it\\'s important to remember that it\\'s not the government\\'s job to write laws based on family and religious stupidity.  You\\'re also now expanding things far beyond the scope of the original discussion by bringing in the global situation.  Remember, many of those countries you\\'re talking about don\\'t have much in the way of child support laws either.  From the beginning, we\\'ve been pretty clearly talking about developed nations where abortion is fundamentally legal (regardless of whatever nonsense the Republicans are up to), so it\\'s disingenuous to bring an entirely separate class of cases into it. As the other guy mentioned, those specific situations aren\\'t excluded (the logic is supposed to be that child support is for the child\\'s benefit and not the mother, but theory doesn\\'t always translate well into practice).  But even if we did just allow those two situations, I would still argue that the general idea (always being able to financially abort) should be an option. This really comes down to the fact that I believe nobody should have a child that they cannot afford. It\\'s rational to not have a child (or want to abort if accidental pregnancy occurs) when money is tight. A law that forces otherwise goes against the original intent of the people having sex (I\\'m presuming that people who have sex do not want a child unless they discuss and agree before hand).  Further, requiring child support payments could be viewed as damaging to the payee. It\\'s a major expense that can financially cripple those who don\\'t have a lot of extra cash (which is quite a lot of people). Especially if you get thrown in prison if you can\\'t make the payment *yet still have to make future payments* (despite prison obviously ruining your finances even more).  However, I should note that I\\'m referring solely to cases where the an unwanted pregnancy occurs and not cases where a family with existing children separates (which is very different).  There\\'s also the case of when the father is not informed until after the birth or if the father cannot be found. It\\'s my opinion that in those cases, the father would be absolved from paying child support (unless they want to, but that\\'s something for them to do personally and not a court matter). This is because if finances are an issue, the woman always has the power to abort or put the child up for adoption.  As you can tell, I have very strong views against having children that you\\'re knowingly not financially able to support. This is a utilitarian view that won\\'t be popular with many, but I believe to be very rational and maximizes economical fairness. I agree with most of what you say except:   >The law must be just.  The law serves the best interests of society. We\\'re better off living in communities than alone but those communities only function under the law. We sometimes design laws that are not perfectly just because we believe that the outcomes will be more desirable. This is a case in which, no matter how you split it, there will be some injustice towards father, mother, or child. Making a perfectly just law here is impossible. So what we do is attempt to set up laws that provide the best outcomes. As it happens, many believe that ensuring the financial future of the child trumps the man\\'s right to perfect justice. I\\'m, not sure that I agree but there you have it.  That concensual issue applies to women as well.  They consented and didn\\'t plan it but now it\\'s there.  Both have to deal with that, so it\\'s not fair to say to a man, hey no one forced you, and then having no say.  Then say a woman can abort and not say \"hey, you knew the risks.  Can\\'t abort, you consented and now you have to live with it.\" > This loops back to my other comment where I talked about abortion not always being a viable option for a woman, so again, this is untrue. Even if she gets an abortion, she\\'s still forced to have a pregnancy as the result of a rape, and either have an invasive medical procedure to get out of that situation or carry a rapist\\'s baby for 9 months if abortion is not an option.  Ok. So? How is that relevant?  >This is like saying motherhood that is not consented to is forced.  Motherhood and pregnancy are not the same thing.   >Having consenting sex with a person of the opposite gender is consent to be a parent, period.  Morally, it is not. Legally, it is not for women - though it is for men.   >Would it be incredibly wrong to intentionally deceive someone about birth control?   Yet it is 100% legal for a woman to deliberately get pregnant and force a man to pay child support. Even if she admitted what she did in court, nothing would change, because the law is on her side.  That is unjust.  >Women are obligated to be financially responsible for their children, what are you talking about?  Not if they choose not to be.   >If a woman wants to give up a child for adoption with a named father, she is unable to do so without the father\\'s consent.  That is easy enough to do. Simply don\\'t name the father. ',\n \"Sure it has the capacity to grow. I've been to Red Bull Arena, and it's a great venue. However, mid season games left the stadium of 20,000 mostly empty. It's frustrating because New Jersey (where RBNY plays) has a large amount of youth soccer players, but somehow that doesn't translate to high attendance and interest in domestic teams. This is purely anecdotal (but I don't know if a stat exists) but I live in a part of Texas that is majority Hispanic. The vast majority of 2nd and especially 3rd generation Americans dont even follow soccer. They play football and basketball at the same percentage as the white and black kids.  The proportion of Black Americans is not changing significantly, so I don't think they'll be involved in shaping any changes in the wide popularity of certain sports. The proportion of Latino and White demographics *are* changing significantly, and this could result in an upward trend.   I'd also add that the MLS is adding new teams all the time and is slated to continue adding into 2017. New soccer stadiums have been built in many major cities in the last 15 years. This all suggests to me that the fan base could eventually grow to be pretty substantial. Nothing suggests the sport is stagnant or in decline.  This might imply that liking soccer is an ethnic, rather than cultural thing. I think it's more likely that Latins in America will just be interested in what everyone else is interested in, i.e. currently popular American sports.  I can only speculate, as well, but perhaps the later generations are simply acculturating to the popular sports here in the US. Makes sense to me. mmm. I live in San Antonio (who just got a soccer team a year or two ago : go scorps) and it's definitely not as prevalent as in Mexico, but definitely more important than in most other states with less latin population.  And that's normal, since those second and third generation people will have grown up in an environment that mostly watches football and basketball.   I'm a 2nd generation immigrant to Canada (no Latino) and my sport is hockey. I like soccer, as my dad did, but not nearly to the same extent as hockey. It took one generation for the Canadian preferences to take hold in my family.   That being said, we have better access to sports from around the world today than we did when my parents came over, so there is less reason for adults moving from, say, Argentina, to stop watching Argentine soccer than there was 20 years ago. If they keep watching it in the house every week, some percentage of the children will get into it.   If, at the same time, the quality of MLS increases, there's good reason to suspect that there might be a tipping point and soccer might become more popular.  Fair, but that's implying that with the decline in white population as a percent of the total is transferring directly to a latino increase. I would argue that black culture tends to revolve around football and basketball as the two major sports. With that not changing anytime soon, that prevents a major portion of the population from getting super involved.  I see interest in the sport remaining cyclical for quite some time. Maybe there will be a slight upward trend in interest? I believe that will be for the national team only, and not for the MLS. that's more because of the way Red Bull is run...Seattle Sounders get 50,000 a game, Sacramento and Indianapolis sell out every game (10k +) for lower league games while Atlanta has already sold something like 15,000 season tickets for a team that doesn't really exist yet!\",\n '',\n 'This is a terrible argument to make though.  If we were able to change from racist and sexist teachings of the past, then we can certainly do the same for LGBT teaching. This is a great answer, and the point about how much we have to change yet in these old stories is a great point. We are just starting to change some of the more misogynistic elements in these stories - that women have to be in a relationship with a strong male character to feel valued, for one (all the Disney princesses prior to Frozen). I think that for us to move forward with kids\\' entertainment, we need to take out the princess/prince relationship element entirely. It is interesting to me that Disney almost always plays on that romantic angle (as does nearly every thing that comes out of Hollywood), whereas stories from Studio Ghibli in Japan (Hiyao Miazaki films) do not at all. Seems like we could learn something from that, and maybe not drag children into this whole romance thing so early. They will think of it on their own soon enough! Except, even if they were in a relationship, I wouldn\\'t put them as an example for children.   They don\\'t get along very well, at least from what I remember.    > Not sure what you\\'re trying to say: that the realities of their lives like single parenting and homosexuality should not be portrayed in fairy tales, but only discussed \"offline\"?  I think Atradonna addressed your point quite clearly:  >most children\\'s media is not original. Schools use books and stories that teachers are familiar with and that aren\\'t too expensive for the school board to dig up. It\\'s too late to change the heteronormativity of history, so most go-to stories like fairy tales are about boys and girls marrying young.   He isn\\'t addressing generating new content, he is talking about working with existing fairy tales, and then providing discussion about how they might not clearly represent modern times.  I don\\'t think his statements preclude the creation of new fairy tales, they just represent a more realistic view that older, cheaper materials are more likely to be used. it\\'s not a terrible argument, it\\'s a financial reality.  Oh, yes I absolutely did. We altered racist and sexist books and media by censoring the content. For example the N word was removed from huckleberry Finn. This is an was change because it simply requires deleting a single word. Where as inclusivity for lifestyles that do not align with those presented in the hypothetical novel would arguably alter the content the author was intending to portray. This could be seen as changing the underlying meaning of the novel which I see as as big of an issue as a heteronormative society. I am adamantly against censure for any reason especially when reframing the context of a novel so that a child or student understands it isnt representative of modern society is a cleaner solution. I hadn\\'t even thought of altering existing content. I was thinking that emphasis should be placed on making the changes in content going forward. > The focus for children is on making friends of both sexes rather than romantic relationships of any kind. > My personal view is that children are drawn too early and hastily into wanting romance  Not every portrayal of couples in children\\'s productions needs to focus on the quest for romantic relationships (princes falling in love with princesses etc.) But what if Dora the Explorer introduced two uncles who are presented as a couple, or Peppa Pig\\'s friend, who has two mommies?  > This leaves the door open to teach children that the realities of their lives (single parents, homosexuality, etc.) do not need to fit a fairy-tale mold without being prematurely explicit.  Not sure what you\\'re trying to say: that the realities of their lives like single parenting and homosexuality should not be portrayed in fairy tales, but only discussed \"offline\"?   I see them having a similar role as messages against racism/sexism/ableism etc. in an age-appropriate way. In South-Africa, there is even an [HIV-positive Muppet](http://www.unicef.org/media/media_16631.html), to help with de-stigmatization and acceptance of people living with HIV/AIDS.

If there\\'s 5 people in the dept including Ricky that just means the other four have to do 120% of the work and that still isn\\'t quite fair.   Though I\\'ll award your delta, since if it is in fact the case that his compensation comes from some sort of assistance program rather than the store\\'s funds itself. That at least makes it make a little more sense why they would be less quick to terminate him for dereliction of duty.  I know you gave a delta as a result of /u/moonflower \\'s comment, and your view was already clarified/changed based on that, but I wanted to make another related point.    I want to point out that there is a good chance that neither Julian nor Ricky was taking home a paycheck that was anywhere near to your level of pay.  I don\\'t know if knowing that would settle your mind or accept the situation any more than you already have.  The same government programs that facilitate getting people jobs like this also have provisions where the pay rate is literally in the slave labor zone.  This is because the job is not meant to support them fully, but is meant to keep them socially integrated into society versus locked away at home alone/with only their immediate caregivers.  The job duties and pay are a far and much less emphasized second goal in this whole concept.  Now this may sound like I have an axe to grind with these low paying programs, but I don\\'t.  Seriously.  I see them as providing a great service.  The extremely low pay requirement incentives more employers to hire people in need, and to put up with a reasonable amount of issues that often come along with the employee.     **EDIT:**  Looks like it is not even nessisarily part of the specifc programs, but is an allowance under federal law.  In the good old US of A at least....  **\"A provision in the Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA) of 1938 gives employers the right to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage. At Goodwill, explains Leigland, disabled employees take a timed test to see how quickly they can sort and hang a rack of clothes. The garments must be facing to the left and the top buttons fastened and separated into men’s, women’s and children’s sections. Goodwill wants workers to be able to hang 100 garments with no errors in 32 minutes. “We can’t do it that quickly because we can’t look at a garment and see the size,” she says about her experience and her husband’s. Depending on how slow the employee works, Goodwill lowers the hourly wage.\"** Consider that they\\'re \"extra\" employees. Perhaps your store only needs a little help, and they provide that little bit. They\\'re not actually a burden, you just perceive it that way because they\\'re not taking an equal share of the task, but the task you have is something you can handle without excess exertion, and the same goes for them.   Consider it this way. A large, strong person and a small, weak person are tasked with moving 300 lbs of stuff 100 feet. They resolve to carry it as the best method. An equal share would be 150 lbs, which the strong person would carry with relative ease (75% max load) while the weak would struggle unduly (125% max load). A more fair compromise would be perhaps a 200/100 split, or 125/175 even. Both workers will be pulling maximum output for their potential, perhaps like your store. (Though I will concede that your store may not be properly managed and they failed to take that into account, however I feel I\\'ve given you a good generalized case for how it could be fair even if in reality it is not in all situations)',\n '> If good genes/environment occur, then it\\'s highly likely good life choices will occur.

That said, this is kind of a worthless general discussion, and I wouldn\\'t degrade it further by making up statistics or using quantifying statements like \"mostly\".

Just wanted to make that clear before moving forward (because I will address your points).  > Whether they see money or not is irrelevant in my opinion. Nobody > deserves to make a profit. Additionally, there\\'s no reason to expect > that recording music should be the way a musician makes money. > It\\'s a relatively new thing and not a traditional thing for musicians to > do historically, and should really be more of an extra convenience to > allow people to hear your music.  Historically, a great way of making money from mines was to buy a bunch of slaves, throw them in it, have them dig stuff out for you regardless of the dangers, and pay them nothing for it. I suppose you\\'d be inclined to return to this time? What did or didn\\'t happen historically is only relevant to the present in what mistakes we should seek to avoid making. Just because something isn\\'t the \"traditional way\" of making money doesn\\'t mean you shouldn\\'t be expected to make money that way. Manufacturing wasn\\'t a \"traditional\" way of making money, so should we deny them money by breaking into the factory and stealing all the sofas? After all, by your own argument, manufacturing is only a recent (on even the human timescale) invention, and therefore not a traditional way of making money (or sofas, for that matter), so let\\'s go steal the damn things! Perfectly OK, right?  You argument is so self serving that it\\'s clear you care about nothing and no one except those you consider your immediate friends, family, and property.

You\\'re not sharing photos of a cookie - even if you argue that the live experience has an extra facet of reality to it, you can\\'t simplify that to the picture of a cookie. You\\'re still getting the essence of the cookie out of it when you pirate MP3s - you\\'re just not getting the whole thing.

And maybe you don\\'t pay as much for a cookie-flavored milk drink as for a cookie, but somehow I doubt you claim \"This isn\\'t a cookie,\" grab said drink, and sprint out of the grocery store, avoiding guards and police. This is, however, what you\\'re advocating.  Your piracy of that music denies not only the musician, but also the recording technician, the track mixer, the CD burner, the CD printer, the distributor, and the retailer money. And say what you like about musicians, but as long as those other careers have existed, they are doing what they have traditionally done in those careers to make money.  > I would only note that it\\'s not necessarily true that the infrastructure exists because it is monetarily profitable - it\\'s true that it makes money, but many also sport donation buttons that I have no doubt are clicked extremely often.

I didn\\'t ever see it from this point of view. Could you give me some numbers, though? > Downloaders are the basis of an economy which hurts copyright holders, even if they themselves never uploaded anything.  I disagree with this.  Copyright holders are not entitled to make a profit by simply existing.  Since they are not being robbed of money, nor physical copies of their media, nor are they (normally) being hacked and having their content stolen that way or deleted from their site, the existence of \"piracy\" has no actual impact on their sales.  Generally, most piracy occurs through someone else making a purchase to obtain that content, then redistributing it in some way.  Me sharing some MP3s with my friend of a CD that I bought is no more immoral than me buying cookies from a bakery, then finding a recipe to make them at home, and making them for my friend.  The fact that I gave the same type of cookies to my friend doesn\\'t mean that the bakery lost money.  Maybe my friend would have gone to buy cookies there, maybe not, but they have no right to my friend\\'s money. Your point 3 about the infrastructure being profitable is wrong for very large private trackers.  I know of many huge trackers who are not breaking even.  Many don\\'t even run ads.  And by large I\\'m talking trackers with 150k, or 40k, or 24k users(the ones I bothered to check the user count on).  Even with tons of users these sites are making negative profit. Shh we don\\'t talk about the failures of the industry here.  Seriously though, I completely agree with you. Every time they sue someone for millions of dollars, citing the maximum fine for each individual seed, it\\'s like \"we are going to ruin your life over $0.99. Have a good day\". It would be one thing if the individuals had any way of fighting this but as a multi-billion dollar organization, they can just stomp all over everyone. I would only note that it\\'s not necessarily true that the infrastructure exists because it is monetarily profitable - it\\'s true that it makes money, but many also sport donation buttons that I have no doubt are clicked extremely often.  But it is definitely true that the people who run them believe that the act of running these sites justifies the leftover cost after advertising revenue. The industry which has suffered the worst is the print publishing industry.  The next worst off is the music industry.  The next worst off is the movie industry.  The next worst off is the video game industry.  The extent to which these industries are suffering is almost entirely correlated to the size of their content, which in turn correlates to the ease with which it can be downloaded.  It has little to do with how they\\'ve adapted, but still, not nothing. How do they keep their sites running?  If they get donations, then these donations come from downloaders.  If so, then the downloaders are still ultimately hurting copyright holders. Piracy gave us the idea that we could download individual songs.  The result is iTunes and similar sites selling songs one at a time and pandora and songza letting you stream instead of buy.  The music industry failed to properly adapt and that\\'s what\\'s hurting them. Game and movie industries are still doing record breaking sales and they have just as much piracy. The difference between MP3s and cookies is that MP3s are not one time use.  In that hypothetical situation, your friend likes the cookies you give him and asks where you got them. You tell him about the bakery where you first got the cookies, and now he goes there once a week to pick up a dozen cookies for himself. Your sharing of cookies ultimately leads to the bakery making money. Alternatively, if your friend is not me and can actually make food without burning down his domicile, you share the recipe with him and the market where you buy ingredients makes money (since clearly if you can replicate the taste at home, there isn\\'t any need to go to the bakery). Either way, someone makes money as a result of the sharing of cookies.  However, when you give that same friend a ripped MP3 off of a CD, he NEVER NEEDS TO BUY ANYTHING. He can re-use that copy of the MP3 a million and one times and still have the ability to do it again. The only point of sale is when you buy the MP3 - after that, the guys making the music, paying for the recording equipment, editing the tracks, burning the CDs, printing the inserts, distributing the CDs, finally retailing them DO NOT SEE MONEY.   In a purely free market setting, there would only be copies of CDs sold until one person uploads the whole thing online. At that point, the CDs would not sell, unless people valued the case and insert for the CDs, as well as the support given to the artist (if they care about that at all), at whatever price they were being sold at. Are you telling me that your friend has the right to listen to that music that he never did a thing for? Because he didn\\'t - you were the one that went to the effort of ripping the MP3s. He got goods without paying in any fashion, monetary, labor, or otherwise. > The music industry failed to properly adapt and that\\'s what\\'s hurting them.  Sure it is.  No question about that.  But what\\'s hurting them even more, is freeloading. A large number of users live in areas where there is no means for them to legally acquire the material they want, so there\\'s no way that they can hurt copyright holders.  Plus, while a percentage of pirates spend nothing on legal material, the ones who do spend spend a lot more than non-pirates.  The ones who spend nothing are likely to be either too poor to afford material or in an area where the material is unavailable anyway.  > The difference between MP3s and cookies is that MP3s are not one time use.  That\\'s why I tried to make it a little different by switching to a recipe instead of just an actual physical cookie.  Specifically, this works like buying a CD, then making a copy of that CD to give to a friend (or instead of a D, making MP3s.)  > However, when you give that same friend a ripped MP3 off of a CD, he NEVER NEEDS TO BUY ANYTHING.

If we go back to the cookie reference, it\\'s one thing to share a photo of a cookie and another to physically eat one.  For the record, I play guitar and many of my friends are musicians.  Maybe because none of us are famous we don\\'t care, but I\\'ve got a few friends who are in bands and are some of the biggest music pirates imaginable (I\\'m not, but then again I prefer to pay my $7/month for Google Play music so I don\\'t have to download anything.)  From my perspective recorded music is no different than pictures of food on the internet.  It\\'s not the real thing and as much as I\\'d love to get rich doing nothing but playing guitar I don\\'t see it as stealing from me if someone downloads an MP3 of me.  I\\'d be happy that they like my sound. I disagree with that. No other industry that suffers from piracy is hurting like they do. They failed to adapt. That\\'s their main downfall. It\\'s pretty well-established empircally that P2P file-sharing has had a negative impact on music sales.  The RIAA reports that music sales have [dropped by 47 percent](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/illegally-downloading-music-impact-music-industry-27748.html) since the advent of Napster, and the studies cited [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_file_sharing#Music_industry) support the idea that piracy hurts the profitability of media in general with more detailed analysis.  Like in most of the social sciences, this is of course not a fully falsifiable thesis (neither is the thesis that P2P *hasn\\'t* had a negative impact), because you can\\'t fully isolate one factor as the cause, however most economists recognize that the music industry is less well off than it would be without piracy.  The argument I gave is all based on this premise in (1), that piracy hurts copyright holders and creators of content.  While there may be individual exceptions, this is pretty intuitive and I think, obviously true. > the existence of \"piracy\" has no actual impact on their sales.  This has been empirically shown to be false.  > Me sharing some MP3s with my friend of a CD that I bought is no more immoral than me buying cookies from a bakery, then finding a recipe to make them at home, and making them for my friend.  This analogy is inaccurate.  Buying cookies and then sharing the recipe with your friend is analogous to you downloading the song, then transcribing it it to musical notation and giving the musical notation to your friend.  I agree that copyright holders have no right to your money, but you also have no right to their content.  This is how property ownership works.  Whether non-physical things should be able to be owned is an open question, but I think you probably agree that they should.

I had thought that I was describing such an approach.  P(test history | true user) * P(true user) = P(true user | test history) * P(test history)  P(test history | true nonuser) * P(true nonuser) = P(true nonuser | test history) * P(test history)  Therefore P(test history | true user) * P(true user) is proportional to P(true user | test history), correct? By the same proportion (of P(test history), which is unknown and sort of a silly thing to calculate) by which the same is true for the probabilities of a true nonuser.  Since we know that P(true user | test history) + P(true nonuser | test history) = 1 (by definition, true user and true nonuser are the only possibilities), surely we can normalize them to recreate the effect of knowing P(test history) without actually needing to do so? >As an interesting note, depending on the number plugged in, it\\'s entirely possible that P(true user | no test results either way) (the prior probability of drug use) is sufficiently low as to justify stopping testing before any tests are ever given, in which case the sensible public policy would be, as you say, not to administer random drug tests. But the goodness of that policy is contingent on the numbers, which I do not know.  I agree. This is similar to my argument.  >One should be able to roughly calculate the probability that the individual is a drug user with the assumption that each test is independent. Assign a score that corresponds to \"true user\" as P(test 1\\'s result (positive or negative) on test 1| true user) * P(test 2\\'s result on test 2|true user)...*P(true user), and a similar score to \"true nonuser\", normalize them, and get your probabilities there.   No, please no! This is a very mathematically dangerous tactic! This is why I am promoting a Bayesian approach.   I don\\'t quite know.  It depends on how important you think punishing/rehabilitating/identifying actual drug users is, versus how much of a problem it is for someone to be mistakenly punished/rehabilitated/identified.  One should be able to roughly calculate the probability that the individual is a drug user with the assumption that each test is independent.  Assign a score that corresponds to \"true user\" as P(test 1\\'s result (positive or negative) on test 1| true user) * P(test 2\\'s result on test 2|true user)...*P(true user), and a similar score to \"true nonuser\", normalize them, and get your probabilities there.  If at any point the P(true user | test history) is so low that the expected utility of identifying and treating this individual is lower than the cost (in terms of money, inconvenience and potential reputational damage to the subject, etc.) of administering another test, cease administering tests and declare this individual a nonuser.  If at any point the P(true user | test history) is so high that the expected utility of identifying and treating this individual is higher than the cost of doing so, cease administering tests and declare this individual a user.  If neither of these things are the case, continue administering tests.  As an interesting note, depending on the number plugged in, it\\'s entirely possible that P(true user | no test results either way) (the prior probability of drug use) is sufficiently low as to justify stopping testing before any tests are ever given, in which case the sensible public policy would be, as you say, not to administer random drug tests.  But the goodness of that policy is contingent on the numbers, which I do not know. Interesting take in the situation. How many confirmation tests are performed and do you feel that the number is satisfactory?  The might not always (or even often) be the real world case, but I was under the impression most of the time if a drug screening is failed, the sample gets sent for confirmation analysis.   A 5 panel piss cup test is not enough to confirm anything, in my opinion, but if you use that as an indicator of when you should send the sample in for gas chromatography analysis you might have a more reliable system. ',\n 'Why they would or why they wouldn\\'t?  You need a head of state. In US-style systems the president is both head of state and head of government. They are elected separately from the legislature, and have a different dynamic with the legislature (often they don\\'t work together because they can be from separate parties).  In the Europe-style system the legislature elects a Prime Minister who is the head of government. Then there is either a ceremonial president or a ceremonial monarch who is head of state.  The PM could also be head of state, but this would unorthodox. No other country does it that way. Some of the benefits people say of splitting head of government and head of state is that your head of state can be more of a neutral \"mascot\" that everyone can mostly agree on. The head of state in this system represents the whole country, not just one political faction.   Also, the head of government is elected by the legislature which makes sure the entire government is on the same page (compare to gridlock in the US), but this is at the expenses of a check-and-balance. A separate head of state provides an emergency check and balance as they have a few emergency reserve powers. This could prevent a democratically elected dictator (say like Hitler who was elected PM) from gaining complete control over the country in one sweep. Parliament already has control over the Crown Estates as others have mentioned. You\\'re also saying that the monarchy should keep it\\'s titles and use of a palace or two for tourism. So the only thing you want to change is that bills passed by Parliament would stop being signed by the Monarch? Would the Monarch still be head of state or would you want an additional ceremonial president to replace them? There is nothing in the first to imply the second. The easiest way constitutionally to abolish the monarchy is to technically make the Crown controlled by the Speaker of the House of Commons. The UK keeps all current legal apparatus and the revenue of the Crown estate that way, whilst still keeping it non partisan. It can, and in many countries it is. They are separate roles though. Although a head of state has no legislative powers, he can often veto legislation, choose who will be the head of government (after elections), fire the government and call for new elections as well as lead the armed forces. Some people think it\\'s a good idea to keep them separate to prevent the sort of abuses a 2 in 1 role could lead to. ok playing some devils advocate here:  Wouldn\\'t the monarch be replaced with a president? (similar to france, portugal, etc..) and if so, arguably, that could have a cost of 40 to 299 million pounds per year. A president generally requires a place to live in and receive visits of chiefs of state, the maintenance it comes with it, advisors, staff, travel arrangements, etc.. > All else being equal  There\\'s the flaw in your argument right there. I can make any argument work in my favour if I disregard those factors which disagree with me. All things aren\\'t equal, all members of nobility are not born exactly the same, all those who have landed titles are not born with the same attributes. And they do not all experience the same lives.  And as I mentioned in a previous post on this thread, you cannot judge the actions of the past with the morals of today. You can reflect on them certainly, and say that **based on today\\'s understandings** it was wrong, but families who were granted titles or lands or whatever based on now defunct laws cannot be dismissed as being \\'undeserved\\' of their gains, because at the time they most likely were. I admit, there are plenty of cases of gains through nepotism or similar reasoning, but some were granted titles or land for valor in battle and other such actions.  The way that you can dismiss an entire group of people in such a blasé fashion concerns me, because your way of looking at things can be applied to anything.  **All things being equal, a man who was sent to prison for falsifying a job application should never be allowed a job again, because we know they\\'ve been granted at least one undeservedly.**  **All things being equal, a woman who has an abortion should never be allowed to have children, because we know they\\'ve given up the opportunity once and they obviously hold a disregard for it.** In those systems the President (combined head of state and government) is elected separately from the legislature. Making the PM head of state is not impossible, but it would be a radical departure from how other government are run. There are many reasons why countries prefer having separate head of states and head of governments.   >The PM could also be head of state, but this would unorthodox. No other country does it that way. Some of the benefits people say of splitting head of government and head of state is that your head of state can be more of a neutral \"mascot\" that everyone can mostly agree on. The head of state in this system represents the whole country, not just one political faction.   Actually three countries have this system: Botswana, South Africa and Suriname (this person is called the president, but essentially fills the role of the PM). Several subnational governments also use this system (e.g. premiers in South African provinces and minister-presidents in German states)  Doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a good idea, though. From the South African constitution:  >102(2) If the National Assembly, by a vote supported by a majority of its members, passes a motion of no confidence in the President, the President and the other members of the Cabinet and any Deputy Ministers must resign. I was suggesting the PM assume that duty ok refuting my own point:  - did some research, and a presidency of a country such as Portugal [costs only 14 million euros a year](http://sg.presidencia.pt/DSAF/Pag/content.aspx?Menu=Administra%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Financeira%20e%20de%20Recursos%20Humanos&Submenu=Or%C3%A7amento&ContentId=Content_SubmenuOrcamento) - a unified system is possible like /u/Eluxx and /u/panderingPenguin have said Except we already know that the professional world and a law-based system of nepotism ARE separate entities... Of course there is. If we can show that one has been granted one title through nepotism, it is reasonable to conclude that they have acquired any other titles in the same fashion. To assume otherwise is to [unnecessarily multiply entities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor). I feel like you take a very sinister and cynical view of the nobility in the UK. Just because they come from privileged backgrounds does not preclude them from being intelligent and earning or deserving their qualifications. I take your point that their acceptance into top institutions might have been influenced by their family or their title, but I don\\'t agree that then defines them as being somehow undeserving of the final result.  Being a member of nobility or royalty does not also guarantee you good grades or entry into high end institutions. [Prince Harry did rather poorly at the A-Level stage before university, gaining a B in Art and a D in Geography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry#Education) and then went on to a military career. At the time, he was 3rd in line to the throne. So I don\\'t see that your argument holds true. All else being equal, we should presume they haven\\'t earned any titles they may have, because we know they\\'ve been granted at least one undeservedly. It\\'s a very slippery slope once you start asking why should we respect \\'their\\' land rights, because the definition of \\'they\\' has a tendency to be defined on the whim of those with the power. If you go back far enough, most land ownership was taken under what would be considered now to be morally reprehensible means. But we can\\'t judge the past on today\\'s laws and today\\'s morals, because that\\'s not the aim of progress. We have to accept that, yes, it happened that way but no, we can\\'t suddenly overturn it because we don\\'t like it. Most laws aren\\'t retrospective, and certainly not hundreds of years in the past. Absolutely, it would not be ideal or remotely practical to implement smoothly. I don\\'t understand why the prime minister would be the head of state. The body is mostly not hereditary now. That was reformed around 2000.  Out of 792 members, 92 are hereditary and 26 are from the Church of England. The rest of appointed for life terms by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister (in effect by the Commons).   The Lords also used to act as the supreme court until the 2009 when they created a proper UK Supreme Court.  Why? As a debating club, many non-politicians from a plethora of fields are appointed who can offer different insights. They also act as a check and balance against the Commons. Remember that the Commons and Executive are fused and the Supreme Court still can\\'t deem laws unconstitutional as there is no written constitution. There are very few other built in checks and balances compared to a US-style government. Other reasons are that as a body it is conservative, so conservative administrations like it. Also it\\'s part of tradition -- having a bicameral legislature is how it\\'s been done for around a thousand years so people are reluctant to get rid of it.  In effect they don\\'t have that much power, and can be overridden by the Commons. I believe that their one year \"holding power\" can be shortened to about a month if the bill is deemed urgent by the Commons. You could, I suppose, make the argument hereditary titles were ethical within the culture which they were originally granted, but none of the people who hold them today ever lived in that culture. _Today_ holding such a title is considered a significant ethical breach, and it many parts of the Commonwealth is quite illegal.  That you would cast aspersions on women who have abortions reflects solely on your own character, and I will not deign to respond to it. Not likely. The British monarchs are only minimally involved in actual governance of the country. The Prime Minister is much more analogous to presidents in other countries in that they act as the head of the government.  Since they already have someone (the Prime Minister) filling this role, removing the monarchy would not necessitate adding a president. It\\'s less powerful now than it was even a few years ago, but it still has a role in setting the house of common\\'s agenda. If it got to the point where they were abolishing the Monarchy, I doubt Parliament would have any qualms fully taking possession of the Crown. I\\'d also be pro-Monarchy if I was British, but I think the argument about the Crown Lands is very facetious. I believe that the Crown Estates are **not** property of the Crown.  [See here:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Estate) > Although nominally belonging to the monarch and inherent with the accession of the throne, the Crown Estate, like the Crown Jewels, is not the private property of the reigning monarch and cannot be sold by him or her, nor do any revenues, or debts, from the estate accrue to the monarch, as they no longer govern in person. That role has been replaced by the de facto authority of Parliament  The Crown has several private properties- Balmoral for example, and retains private income from the Duchy of Lancaster, which itself became part of Crown lands in 1399 when Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, ascended to the throne. The fact that these entities lie separate to the Crown Estates demonstrates that they occupy slightly different legal places.  This legal nuance is explained in other Commonwealth nations, such as Canada and Australia, where \\'Crown land\\' is the term synonymous with public land.  If the monarchy was deprived of its position, it would not automatically be handed the Crown Estate. At most it would be given the Duchy of Lancaster and its private houses. The vast majority of the \\'Crown lands\\', and thus the vast majority of the wealth, would occupy a nebulous position somewhere within the hands of the nation, I believe. I would have to defer to a higher legal authority for clarification on this point.  Unfortunately, we know quite well that that is not the case. George W. Bush, for example, was awarded a degree from Yale. No reasonable person could argue that he would be granted admittance on his own merits, let alone graduate.  I\\'m not sure how to respond to that. Are you thinking of his father? Is there any reason why the PM couldn\\'t be the head of state? Wow.  TIL  Why on earth is a hereditary body with such power found acceptable (apparently) by the UK? And why should you respect their land rights?  Their claims come from a time where they claimed that all private property was really theirs.  A time in which all English people were under the yoke of the nobles who treated them like crap, kept them down (legally and socially).  You guys should never have let them keep it because it hinders the common good of all British citizens for the benefit of a very select and privileged few.    You are a country of citizens now.  The rights of Royalty should not exist, including the basis for which they claimed the land.   If they have only ceremonial powers as you state then they aren\\'t really necessary.  I was basically implying that the PM could handle those additional ceremonial duties just as well.  The whole argument for eliminating the monarchy rests on the fact that their duties are mostly ceremonial. If they remove a ceremonial ruler, it\\'s not likely a different ceremonial ruler will be added in such a situation. You\\'re making an assertion there, though. If you believe the circumstances around their acquiring one title differs from another, the burden is on you to show how that is. But if there was a major change in the terms of the relationship between parliament and the crown, which is to say, a total severing of that relationship, such a wrestling match could, hypothetically ensue.  It can delay and amend, there are a few votes that the Commons can\\'t pass without their approval (e.g. suspension of elections a power used twice in the last century). That something is legal does not suggest it is not immoral.  Are you truly arguing that holding a noble title is an moral thing to do? If so, I have misunderstood you, and I\\'m afraid our values are simply incompatible. I take your point, but aren\\'t you overlooking that the Crown Estates are property of the Crown, and that their incomes go to the Government only by Royal Consent. So if we abolished the office, or the position, of Monarch...the family would still own the lands. And they could then withdraw their consent for the incomes to go to the government and keep it for themselves. Which would certainly make up the shortfall. The trouble with that study is that it fails to discount those Members who received their seat through hereditary means, and thus presumably received their professional qualifications through similarly fraudulent ways. I don\\'t understand. You think that because they are hereditary seats, those who inherited them are likely to have inherited their science degrees too? As I\\'ve pointed out elsewhere, academic titles quite often are awarded hereditarily. Google \"legacy program.\" The idea of monarchy is a concept so grounded in popular perceptions of the past, that the notion of deposing a monarchy I feel carries the connotation of anti-authority or counter-cultural movements, but this really need not be the case anymore. No one is proposing the execution of the monarchy, to be replaced by some sort of radical egalitarian state.  The Queen and all of the other members of the monarchy could keep their titles, and even some of their    Parliament could just assert eminent domain over the Crown Estates, leaving aside a few for the monarchy to make use of so that a living, breathing monarchy could be maintained for the sake of the tourists, and then exclude the monarchy from its current, ceremonial role in the law making process.   To me though, the monarchy is less of an issue than the continued existence of a house of lords.  Portugal, Germany, Poland, Italy, Ireland etc. have a ceremonial president. In those systems (called the parliamentary system) the legislative body elects the head of government (Prime Minister) who has executive authority. A separate president is elected who only has ceremonial powers. In a constitutional monarchy (UK, Spain, Sweden, etc.) the same system is used except that instead of a ceremonial president there is a ceremonial monarch.  This is different from how governments are structured in the United States and countries in the Americas which have based their government off of the US. In this system, a directly elected president is both head of government and head of state at the cost of the legislative body being separate and often refusing to work with the president.  Of course you could make the Prime Minister the head of state, but that would be a radical departure from how any other western government is structured. There are many reasons why countries like splitting head of government and head of state. Not necessarily. If you look at [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_heads_of_state_and_government), you can see numerous nations have their head of state and head of government united. A system with a Prime Minister also fulfilling the roles of a President is not alien, and would be unlikely to cost a large sum.  The United States has this system: Obama is head of both. The system is different to us, as the US has a separate legislative (Congress) and executive (Presidency), whereas the UK has its political leader derived, usually, from being head of the dominant party in the Commons.  So I would posit that a like-for-like replacement is by no means necessary, and could be instead derived from the Lords, or extended onto the office of the Prime Minister etc. > Parliament could just assert eminent domain over the Crown Estates, leaving aside a few for the monarchy to make use of so that a living  This would not even be necessary. The terms of the signing over by George III make it clear that the Crown Estates are not the monarch\\'s private property. > The Crown Estate belongs to the reigning monarch \\'in right of The Crown\\', that is, it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign, by virtue of their accession to the throne. But it is not the private property of the monarch - it cannot be sold by the monarch, nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch.  [Taken from here](http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/faqs/#whoownsthecrownestate)  The Crown owns a few palaces: Balmoral, for example. Parliament would not need to wrestle the Crown Estates away from them. [The House of Lords is the only legislature in the G20 with more scientists and researchers than bankers or business owners, clergymen or former journalists combined](http://lordsappointments.independent.gov.uk/media/17348/ucl_report.pdf).  I support an unelected House of Lords because I care more about the breadth of expertise than opinion. No, it would likely be replaced by a Governor General (as in the rest of the Commonwealth), who would be far less expensive. That\\'s a fair point. From what I understood, the terms of the agreement between George III and Parliament was such that they would receive the income of the Crown Lands in exchange for a stipend (because at the time, he was up to his eyes in debt and the Crown Lands didn\\'t have much income). I know that items such as the Crown Jewels and 90% of the art/furnishings/holdings are held \\'in trust for the nation\\' by the Monarch, I didn\\'t realise that extended to the Crown Lands.  As I\\'ve said, I\\'m pro-monarchy. And I certainly don\\'t think that the country is ready in general to abolish it anytime soon. Maybe because of fears of being more like the USA, or more like Europe, or out of sheer nostalgia. But should there come a time that public opinion sways towards removing the establishment, then I will mourn it\\'s passing but it would not be the end of the world. That\\'s interesting because  it\\'s my understanding that at the moment that we don\\'t have a separation of powers.  The royal prerogatives are exercised by the PM already, meaning that although he is not technically the HoS he is the *de facto* HoS. [Last week it voted down a measure to close Young Offender institutes and to send young offenders straight to normal prisons.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30399246) Yes it fucking matters.

I should qualify that as \"developed country\".',\n 'Yeah, but not because of some arbitrary shit like race. Because of biological differences. Except that the reason there *aren\\'t* men\\'s shelters is that they\\'re all women\\'s shelters. If you started a trend of creating gender discriminatory soup kitchens you\\'d see the same pattern. The need is irrelevant, the sexist imperative to coddle women will ensure that when resource distribution is discriminatory the lion\\'s share will go to women, because more people are interested in trying to help women *specifically* than men *specifically* regardless of need.    Saying that it\\'s morally fine to open a shelter that\\'s discriminatory toward men when no resources exist for abused men is absolute bigotry.     Let\\'s make a great school in the middle of a poor black neighborhood with no services and only let white kids in.  This is the winner.  Discrimination is not inherently a bad thing. Discrimination can be used to oppress or to make equal. In the case of a female-only gym, I would argue that its objective is to make equal because although most gyms are technically co-ed, many women might not feel safe or respected. >A women\\'s shelter serves to make victims of abuse at the hands of men more comfortable, so in my book they\\'re a good thing. However that is not to say we should not make these resources available to male victims of abuse in the same capacity.    The problem here is that it\\'s not a slight inconvenience like needing to go to the gym across town. Much of the time that gender discriminatory shelter is the *only* shelter. Men\\'s shelters are almost non-existent because domestic violence against men isn\\'t a socially recognized problem. It\\'s as if the *only* gyms were gender discriminatory and men who didn\\'t go got the shit kicked out of them by their girlfriends.  <Still Devil\\'s advocate> If you disregard the organs that make men and women different, they are the same as well. I think this is he best way to sum this up. We have this horrible connotation that discrimination is always bad, but look around there\\'s plenty of it already. We have separate bathrooms based on gender, separate schools that folks can choose to send their children to ect. The key here is equality. A women\\'s shelter serves to make victims of abuse at the hands of men more comfortable, so in my book they\\'re a good thing. However that is not to say we should not make these resources available to male victims of abuse in the same capacity. Unfortunately I don\\'t really know of any male support groups for abuse survivors out there, but I think we should certainly have them.  A personal example of this that I can speak of came from my work. A little background I work at a public shooting range that in addition to holding public hours provides a number of free classes to people. Most of the classes are open to everyone but we have a few that are exclusively women\\'s only classes. Our rationale is that when a female starts getting into firearms it can be very intimidating to shoot with a bunch of guys standing around watching. Because folks lets face it hunting and the shooting sports are primarily dominated by men. (There are tons of female shooters out there, just not near as many). So at one point we were short handed so I asked one of our volunteer instructors to come out and help. He said he could not in good conscious participate in a class that segregated by gender when there was no male equivalent (although he understood our reasoning for it). This didn\\'t sit well with me, and made me think a lot. I started noticing that while I was helping some male customers in a shooting situation they seemed a bit put off. I\\'m the only girl that works at the range, and I feel that these particular men might have had some sort of aversion to me helping them. I mean stereotypically they should have been the ones who knew what they were doing, not some girl in her early twenties. I talked to my guy friends and they said that some guys might just have been embarrassed by getting instruction on what is seen as a masculine activity from a woman. Until that point I had never really thought about it, I was there to help whatever struggling shooters that needed help.   So we decided to do something about it. We now in addition to the woman\\'s only class have a \"Guy\\'s day at the range\" course. We didn\\'t think it would do well but it has filled up just as quickly as the women\\'s courses and has received good feedback!  I have issues with the article that you linked. Here are a few of them:  > leads us to hypothesize that it is primarily a matter of men abusing women, for at least the following reasons. First, the use of violence as one tactic in an attempt to exercise general control over one’s partner requires more than the willingness to do violence. It requires a credible threat of a damaging violent response to non-compliance (M. A. Dutton & Goodman, 2005). Such a threat is, of course, more credible coming from a man than a woman simply because of the size difference in most heterosexual couples. Second, experience with violence and individual attitudes toward violence make such threats more likely and more credible from a man than from a woman. (7)  Although this is just their hypothesis, it does come from a biased viewpoint that men are more likely to be violent... because men are more likely to be violent? That type of circular reasoning rubs me the wrong way. Further, size difference doesn\\'t matter much; a man might (maybe) be able to knock you out more effectively, but a woman is just as capable of slapping someone as a man is.  > They found that traditional men were more likely to be involved in attacks on their partners than were non-traditional men (8)  So what, exactly, is a \"traditional man?\" The implication is \"one who is more likely to violence\" for the reasons listed in the first section that I\\'ve quoted, which again leads to the circular reasoning of \"men who are more violent are likely to be more violent, because they\\'re more violent.\"  >When a woman slaps her Intimate husband in the heat of an argument, it is unlikely to be interpreted by him as a serious attempt to do him physical harm. Women’s violence is less likely to injure, is taken less seriously, is less likely to produce fear, and is therefore less likely either to be intended as a control tactic or to be successful as one. (8-9)  This here is *outright* ignoring of woman-on-man violence. The paper clearly brushes the impact of WoM violence under the rug.  > a view of marriage as a commitment “for better or worse,” [...] can contribute to the entrapment of women in abusive relationships. (9)  While technically true, this article completely ignores the fact that it could *also* contribute to a man feeling trapped in the relationship \"for better or worse.\"  That\\'s just the first 9 pages, and there\\'s already enough to discredit the paper. It\\'s nothing but biased crap.   Don\\'t get me wrong--I\\'m *all for* really reading into the data. I *wholeheartedly* agree that it\\'s a very good tactic to read into the relationships between things, and sometimes to draw whacky, counterintuitive conclusions that nonetheless accurately describe something, and I think that doing so is the superior method of analyzing data.   However, that\\'s not what this paper is doing. It\\'s clearly drawing a conclusion and then fitting data to that conclusion.  EDIT: Let me rephrase something that I said. This article is mostly quoting other articles, so it\\'s less true that \"this article is brushing things under the rug\" and more true that \"this article is a collection of quotes from *other* articles that brush the issue under the rug, and as such retains that bias.\" An exercise: Remove all gender-specific pronouns.  Instead of thinking \"A woman has hit a man\" think \"A person has hit a person\". The severity of the attack should not be based directly on physical damage, but on the action itself. >It was shut down hard by feminists and is one of the major grievances that is responsible for the negative connotations around the word feminism  I\\'m interested in reading more about that, do you have some books to recommend? To add to the issues with using tautological reasoning and fitting data to it in this case, research into domestic violence rates found that not only are the majority of abusive relationships mutually abusive but the majority of non-reciprocally abusive relationships have a male victim and, counter to the narrative that men are violent while women are not, lesbian couples are more likely to have at least one abusive member than straight couples and gay couples are less likely (I\\'ve seen some reasonable theories as to why but all we can really go off of is the data). No he wasn\\'t. Silverman didn\\'t get funding from the government because there are regulations in Canada about running shelters out of your personal residence.   Silverman was a great man in many respects, but he knew nothing about running an NGO, how to lobby the government for funding, or what the necessary conditions were for obtaining said funding. He blamed the government for not giving him the funds to keep his shelter open, but he was never \\'attacked\\' by proponents of women\\'s shelters. He wasn\\'t well known enough to garner their attention. His suicide note didn\\'t say that he blamed feminists or proponents of anything, only the government.  Should men get funding, sure. But it\\'s not really a zero sum game either. There are plenty of legitimate avenues with which to successfully lobby the government that doesn\\'t come at the cost of women\\'s shelters. There are men\\'s centres, for example, popping up in Canada that haven\\'t been met with any outcry from feminists.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8836719029070366   > This comment has been overwritten by [this open source script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10380-reddit-overwrite) to protect this user&apos;s privacy.

I suppose that\\'s right, but if you were to cut open a black man and a white man and compare what\\'s inside each and makes em tick it would be the same. And I just realized how fucked up that sounded. It certainly would have been possible. This is not, however, a matter of science, but one of history. The testimonies of those responsible is therefore important. One of the most prominent figures in making this change, and a person who faced persecution by government to bring about women\\'s shelters identifies as an anti-feminist and it is her testimony from which I draw the claim. > A women\\'s shelter serves to make victims of abuse at the hands of men more comfortable, so in my book they\\'re a good thing.   I find this sentence discriminitory.  Women are definitely abused by men... but NOT JUST men.    Women\\'s shelters help female victims of abuse.  Back in April I was writing a paper for college and I wrote it on the inequity of gender.  Here are the stats as of April 4th, 2014 as I recorded them for my paper.  >Of the 22 shelters in Utah, 7 have “women” in their name denoting that this is a safe place for women or children in crisis.  Only West jordan has a place for men and their families.  Of the 22 shelters in Utah only 1 can accomodate men and their families. (source location http://utahbar.org/bars/umba/assets/utah_domestic_violence_shelters.pdf)  When I was a victim of domestic abuse, there was no where for me to turn to for help. What I posted was a sociological article. As such it uses some terminology in a context which is unique to the field. For example, a traditional man is somebody who is more likely to hurt people because a traditional man is aggressive and domineering. This is not all men by ANY means whatsoever, but it is the image of masculinity that society pressures men to live up to. Traditional masculinity is hegemonic masculinity, a search term that might get you some useful articles to help in understanding the concept.   A lot of the other issues you take umbrage with are, I think, a result of a poor reading of what is being said. For instance, that first passage you reference is not saying men are more likely to be violent because they are more likely to be violent. It is saying that threats of violence are more credible coming from men because of the socializing institutions which imagine the ideal man as aggressive and the ideal woman as submissive. When a man threatens a woman, we view that as a serious threat because we have an image of how men ought to be. When a woman threatens a man, we don\\'t take that threat seriously because that contrasts with traditional feminine gender roles. Threats of violence from men are more credible and serious because we expect them to be more credible and serious. That\\'s all.   I grant you that this article takes a lot of things for granted, and if you have a problem with how this article defines traditional gender roles there is a wealth of academic literature of that subject. I suppose I shouldn\\'t have assumed that a sociological article in a nonsociological subreddit would have been read from a sociological lens, though. I agree with everything you say except for one important point. By pointing out that 40% of DV victims are men you are using data from the National Family Violence Survey, as I understand it. That fails to take into account the severity or frequency with which DV will happen. [This article](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mpj/2012%20VAW%20General%20Surveys.pdf) draws a distinction between situational couple violence and intimate terrorism. Situational couple violence is less severe and more contingent. Intimate terrorism is present consistently in relationships and much more severe, too often to the point of death. If we look at the rates for situational couple violence the gender distribution does seem fairly high. However if we look at the rates of intimate terrorism it is almost (but not entirely) exclusively men as the perpetrators and women as the victims. Both are domestic violence, but one is far less severe than the other. Both should have services to address their respective issues but it is absurd to claim that, as a general group, there are as many men in need of shelter from abuse as women.   For more reading, I recommend [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Public-Private-Families-Andrew-Cherlin/dp/0078026679/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419959288&sr=1-1&keywords=public+and+private+families+cherlin+7th+edition), which, although absurdly expensive, has a chapter that very clearly lays out the distinction and points out more sources than I have.  >\\t More than 1 in 3 women (35.6%) and more than 1 in 4 men (28.5%) in the United States have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.  http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_executive_summary-a.pdf  There are ~157 million women, and 152 million men in the US  http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf  157,000,000*0.356 = 55.9 million women victims  152,000,000*0.285 = 43.6 million men victims.  43.6/(55.9+43.6)*100% = 43.8% of domestic violence victims are men.  One thing to note is that this study doesn\\'t count a female forcing a man to have sex with her, ie made to penetrate, as rape. Thus male, and some female, victims are not included in these numbers. Have you ever seen the data when they include more classifiers? It\\'s rather interesting from a sociological perspective (especially in light of the arguments for focusing on women in these matters) since simply focusing on non-reciprocal abuse flips the ratio. The data on abuse in same sex relationships is similarly damning for the currently prevailing view as male-male relationships have a lower incidence of abuse than male-female relationships which in turn have a lower incidence than female-female. Of course actually looking at the data (while ignoring the definitions that are designed to artificially support existing narratives) it becomes clear that things like domestic abuse and rape are not gendered issues but human ones and thus both far harder and necessary to solve.  Source to prove your statement:  http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020  >Results. Almost 24% of all relationships had some violence, and half (49.7%) of those were reciprocally violent. In nonreciprocally violent relationships, women were the perpetrators in more than 70% of the cases.   As horrible as it is DV is a very interesting subject. I actually find it kind of strange that I discuss issues that fall under the umbrella if gender issues (admittedly from a rare standpoint, seeing all sides as equally important which has largely led to my disdain for the current narrative and it\\'s supporters) so often while not particularly caring too much about them while I so rarely discuss the issues that I do care about (then again considering how rare it is for people to really care about said issue it isn\\'t that surprising). Outrage and being a victim have been commercialized and that isn\\'t simply slowing but utterly halting the ability of society to truly make progress, even for those who have been made to play the perpetual victim. >The key here is equality  So... Separate but Equal > What? No. That view assumes that there can only be as many shelters as what already exists.  Would you agree that money is a finite resource?  In Utah (my information is from April of 2014, so 8 months ago) there were 22 shelters.  Of those only 1 was willing to help men.  I was denied at the others because it would alarm the women.  (I did this as part of a research paper, so I rehearsed the same script to each shelter)   The earmarked money for shelters is limited, in Utah I would not expect that with 22 shelters, with only 1 taking male victims, that the budget for male victims is as large as the budget for female victims.  Many of the services needed are the same.  The argument that a male presence would alarm the other females at the shelter, demeans women, one they know that not all males are dangerous.  Second, they should understand that other people need help too.  I have, I have been very interested in DV stats once I learned that the traditional narrative is flat out wrong.  I also think this paper is an interesting resource as well.  >The second objective is to document the fact that the deniers of the research showing gender symmetry in PV have dealt with the denied research results by scientifically unacceptable tactics such as concealing those results, selective citation of research, stating conclusions that are the opposite of the data in the results section, and intimidating researchers who produced results showing gender symmetry.   DOl: 10,1891/1 94.6--6560,13.332  http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf >  Men\\'s shelters are almost non-existent because domestic violence against men isn\\'t a socially recognized problem.  There was a push for men\\'s shelters shortly after women\\'s shelters really caught on. This push had support from people who had been part of getting women\\'s shelters established. It was shut down hard by feminists and is one of the major grievances that is responsible for the negative connotations around the word feminism. It isn\\'t so much a problem that isn\\'t socially recognized as a problem that is heavily downplayed in order to play up the gender aspects of domestic violence against women. >The earmarked money for shelters is limited,  There\\'s nothing precluding that funding from being raised if you can show an adequate need for those services. Funding and earmarked money in budgets isn\\'t static or cemented. They can change if enough of a fuss is raised. >Continuing from this, I would posit that gender-segregated shelters are actively harmful as, by excluding the opposite gender, they promote them being stereotyped as dangerous in the eyes of the victims, likely further damaging their ability to interact normally afterwards.  I would disagree with this. Shelters are mostly there for crisis situations and are there first and foremost for the safety of the victims. If victims don\\'t feel safe, they might not get the help they need. I\\'d say deal with the immediate problems first, then deal with the longer-term psychological issues after. The source he gave didn\\'t corroborate his claim. While we can easily see that women\\'s shelters get more funding, Silverman never claimed that he was constantly attacked by proponents of women\\'s shelters, nor have I ever seen any evidence indicating that was the case except from sites like A Voice for Men and similar sites - but they are pretty short on providing evidence supporting that claim.   As I stated in a comment above, Silverman was pretty much off the radar for most advocacy groups because his operation was exceptionally small. His shelter was run out of his house (which was the primary reason for him not obtaining funding - because Canada and Alberta don\\'t fund shelters run out of personal residences) and not many people even knew that it existed. The closest that he came to saying what is being alluded to by /u/phengineer is that he noticed that there were plenty of services for women but none for men. That doesn\\'t mean, however, that he thought he wasn\\'t getting funding because women were receiving those services. Thanks!! >For example, a traditional man is somebody who is more likely to hurt people because a traditional man is aggressive and domineering.  So that only reenforces the idea that a \"traditional\" (violent) man is violent because he\\'s a violent man. That\\'s circular reason and that\\'s not rectified by the fact that it\\'s an industry term.   >It is saying that threats of violence are more credible coming from men because of the socializing institutions which imagine the ideal man as aggressive and the ideal woman as submissive.  The quote says several things. 1) Men are \"credible\" sources of violence. 2) Implied: women are *not* credible sources of violence. 3) Physical size is the determining factor as to what constitutes a credible source of violence. 4) Men are inherently more experienced than women with violence.   So what does that add up to? 4, men are inherently more experienced with violence, therefore 1, men are more credible sources of violence; men are more likely to be violent because men are more violent. That\\'s not an issue with my reading comprehension. Even if we were to argue about the word \"credible,\" which I don\\'t care to, that still leaves the word \"serious;\" the article is clearly implying that threats from men are serious threats and threats from women are not serious threats, *even when the woman is actually hitting the man.*  As I said, I\\'m all for interpreting the data through whichever lens fits. But claiming that \"oh, you wouldn\\'t understand, it\\'s a sociological thing\" doesn\\'t make up for the lackluster article.   Yes, traditional gender roles pidgeonhole the men into the violent role and the woman into the submissive role. But that\\'s an idealized version of a theoretical relationship, and trying to extract data from that is like trying to extract data on real relationships from a Disney movie.  Do you have a source for that 40% statistic?? I\\'ve searching for a place to back up my argument when I tell people that! > This push had support from people who had been part of getting women\\'s shelters established. It was shut down hard by feminists  Do you think it\\'s possible that the people setting up women-only shelters may have also been feminists? > The key here is equality.  I agree with you in spirit, but be careful here.  \"Separate is inherently unequal,\" as they said in Brown vs. BoE.  I think that may be overgeneralizing, but the point is that equality is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for \"proper\" discrimination.  You also need a good *reason* to discriminate, and that, I think, really gets to the heart of OP\\'s question.  Now, in the 2 cases mentioned, I happen to believe that the \"reason\" requirement is amply met, but that doesn\\'t mean it always is. I\\'d say mostly the fact that segregation, \"equal but separate\", was mandated in a lot of places. Black people having a private club or white people doing the same isn\\'t necessarily bad or immoral in my opinion. Forcing people to use one facility vs another based on race or gender is something I *would* consider immoral. >Further, size difference doesn\\'t matter much; a man might (maybe) be able to knock you out more effectively, but a woman is just as capable of slapping someone as a man is.    Or kicking them as hard as they can in the shins, scratching, biting, throwing things, hitting people with objects, pinching, pulling, and every other painful thing people can do to one another.  Thanks, don\\'t think it was necessary since I haven\\'t gotten any messages asking for one but it\\'s still appreciated. > The argument that a male presence would alarm the other females at the shelter, demeans women  Continuing from this, I would posit that gender-segregated shelters are actively harmful as, by excluding the opposite gender, they promote them being stereotyped as dangerous in the eyes of the victims, likely further damaging their ability to interact normally afterwards.  It also throws up a number of issues when you consider victims of same-sex domestic violence. <Devil\\'s advocate> But isn\\'t race a biological difference, too? Being something that cannot be scientifically investigated (a set of historic events), my source is currently the testimony of Erin Pizzey.  It\\'s going to take a bit for me to assemble proper documentation to demonstrate the validity of her story, and I wouldn\\'t accept the standard of evidence I currently have from an opponent. I will try to provide a sufficient standard of evidence in a timely manner. > Do you really not think that there is a difference between a girl slapping her boyfriend in the face, and a man back handing his girlfriend?  That\\'s an unfair question. Yes, there\\'s a difference, because you\\'re describing two different things. No, there\\'s not a difference between a girl slapping a guy in the face and a guy slapping a girl in the face. No, there\\'s not a difference between a guy backhanding a girl and a girl backhanding a guy.   >I know that if my girlfriend slapped me with all her force, I would be upset but relatively physically unharmed, whereas if I slapped her with all of my force she would be quite seriously injured.  I disagree wholeheartedly with you. You\\'re both underestimating your girlfriend\\'s strength and overestimating your own. If you\\'re stronger, there will be maybe a bigger bruise, but (as someone who does martial arts and *knows* the mechanics of hitting someone in the face, I can say:) a full-force slap from your girlfriend is more than enough to give you whiplash and a full-force slap from you is nowhere near enough to do more that.   EDIT: This assumes that one of you isn\\'t a bodybuilder or trained in some form of hand-to-hand combat. ',\n 'and vice versa. I hate going to the desktop version only find it\\'s worse then the mobile site on my phone and not being able to go back. Don\\'t be silly. Plenty of websites work just as great on mobile as they do on desktop.  http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ is the posterboy of this, but plenty of \"real\" websites do it, too.  * [Wanikani review](http://i.imgur.com/x9sLnLX.png) and [Dashboard](http://i.imgur.com/4s6iq1Q.png)  * [Time](http://i.imgur.com/zCHnh9I.png)  * [Sony](http://i.imgur.com/TDik7zj.jpg)  * [DuckDuckGo](https://i.imgur.com/FWdPqa3.png)  * [pomf.se](http://i.imgur.com/cdNkxev.png)  * [Wolfram Alpha](http://i.imgur.com/DUx7RJe.png)  And so on. Good websites look good everywhere. Is designing a good website a challenge? Absolutely. But it\\'s not impossible. And it\\'s the web designers job to design a good website, not a website that looks \"good\" under some arbitrary optimal conditions. If he did mean reddit then yeh, I always use i.reddit.com, works much, much better on mobile then their normal site. I\\'m talking about using one hand to hold the phone and also touch the screen.  It is hard to hold the phone and pinch zoom with the same hand... Still, in 2014 that\\'s unacceptable. It should be HTML5. It\\'s not assumptions - it\\'s actual user data that is used to make the site perform better.  >tiny buttons  pinch to ZOOM, ZOOM, ~~MOTHERFUCKER~~  makes hitting the wrong button a thing of the past If you hit a small button in chrome for android it zooms in that part of the screen. I disagree that Flash has more penetration than HTML5. HTML5 doesn\\'t require any additional plugins. As long as the site has support for the request desktop site button, I don\\'t mind either way. On desktops you are completely wrong. Every browser since IE6 (which is very prevalent at big companies, grandmas desktop, and pirated XP installs) supports flash. However not every browser supports the full suite of HTML5 features that might go into a complex outage map.   Their are ways to make it work and they really should invest into updating their technology. However it works and its very difficult to sell a fix for something that isn\\'t broken.  Reddit News is a very similar style. I switched from Baconreader to Reddit News Yes, often.  This is a primary advantage of having a not-huge phone.  If you are holding something else, you can still use your phone.  I can reach every part of the screen with my thumb with the 4.3 inch screen phone I have.  If I need to type a lot, i\\'ll go to two hands, otherwise the swype style keyboard input makes one handed typing pretty easy. > first of all media queries allow you to use different images for different screen sizes, so there\\'s no real limitation there.  Media queries are a function of CSS. You are breaking accessibility if you aren\\'t using an img tag with alternate text to load images. Not sure how that\\'s a \"big downfall\" -- first of all media queries allow you to use different images for different screen sizes, so there\\'s no real limitation there. Even if that was the case, does it really matter much in this age of hi-res mobile devices? My phone has the same resolution as most laptops (1920x1080). Baconit/BaconReader is very good You seem to be making a case of \"our mobile site is better than our desktop site, ergo the idea of mobile sites is good.\"  A good website will allow anyone to find any information they\\'re looking for quickly and easily and work on a variety of devices. It shouldn\\'t rely on a locked-down technology like Flash, or use rollovers for anything other than a nice effect. There are smarter ways of \"reducing visual clutter\" than using a fucking dropdown menu or whatever. double tap on a blank space This is basically the driving concept behind [responsive design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). I used to think so, but on my phone, when viewing a link or image post, it defaults to comments and you have to click a tiny \\'link\\' icon at the bottom.  It\\'s annoying as shit and I uninstalled it.   > A good website will present information in the best way possible for the medium. An interface that works great on a big screen may not be suited for a small screen. If you try to get the same experience across devices, you end up with Windows 8.  I agree with this quite strongly.  As long as the same information is there, I\\'d much rather use an interface that is medium specific.  I can\\'t tell you how many times I\\'ve struggled with tiny buttons on my phone meant for a desktop browser because I can\\'t find the info I need on the mobile browser.   A mobile browser that has all the same info as a desktop is simply the ideal. > Using their regular site requires flash  Oh man, that must be hell. By the same argument, websites should just be a large version of the mobile site. There\\'s a lot of sites I\\'ve only visited on my phone and so the desktop website should mimic that so that I know where everything is. They do want different things though. When redesigning a site for a branding overhaul, we looked at traffic from mobile and desktop browsers, and they typically went to different places.   Mobile traffic typically accessed our top level product feature pages, contact support, online help articles, or forum.   Desktop was predominantly the store to purchase a product, deeper dives on product pages, or support.   So we adjusted the prominence of the mobile formatting to allow for quicker navigation to those areas. As responsive design became more feasible, we made the same design concessions so that when on a smaller screen, those options are easier to get to.  Actually, it can be said that everyone going to the website is looking for outage reports if the analytics data shows it. If the majority of the visitors were going to pay bills for example, a smart web developer would optimize the landing page for that action.  Normally, you\\'re correct. However, a double tap where you hold your finger down after the second tap, then moving your finger up and down as if you were scrolling, will give you a pinch-style zoom. Very effective for single-handed browsing. Just an FYI, I got redirected to a porn site landing page when I tried opening that link. Might have just been a popup or something, but let others be warned. I don\\'t understand this comment. Did you mistype something? If you meant Reddit instead of \"read it,\" Reddit has a mobile site, official mobile apps, and third-party mobile apps.  With this in mind, your edit still doesn\\'t make sense because the website should always adapt to whatever resolution screen it\\'s feeding.   For example, http://bootstraptaste.com/theme/squadfree/ or any other responsive site can be tested in mobile-resolutions by resizing your browser.   The only reason some websites haven\\'t done this yet is because they\\'re using outdated design methodologies. Considering this, I\\'m not sure what view you want changed. Should websites use modern web standards and simple frameworks like Bootstrap to make their front ends usable on any resolution? Of course.   Therefore the only reasonable thing to say, IMO, to CYV, is that websites should no longer have 2 separate versions of their interfaces, so your initial problem of defaulting to the \"standard\" version doesn\\'t even come into play. >I reject this idea that mobile and desktop users want different things   But they have different tools. My computer has a keyboard and mouse with lots of functionality and capabilities.   My phone I only have tap and swipe. Mobile sites are optimized to work with your touch screen I used baconit for a while, but moved on to readit due to their much more active development. I would recommend both in a heartbeat. Zoom is a terrible thing to rely on, and it\\'s very easy to make a website detect and adapt to different resolutions and aspect ratios. CSS is very powerful these days. That usually zooms to make a column of text fill the screen but is not very helpful for making navigation items more easily tappable. That\\'s an extra step and also requires two hands. It\\'s only for the interactive outage map. While a lot of people do flash poorly, it\\'s possible to deliver a good experience with it. What browser are we talking about?  I doubt all of them have that function.  I never knew about it.  What percentage of users are going to know about something like that?']"
