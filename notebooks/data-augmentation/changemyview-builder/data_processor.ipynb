In fact, I believe Iran having nuclear weapons makes the world less safe overall. However, I believe that as a sovereign nation they have the right to develop nuclear weapons if they so choose.\\n\\nWhy do I believe this:\\n\\n1. It is in Iran's best strategic interests to develop nuclear weapons in order to counter Israel (which has nuclear weapons), and additionally to one-up Saudi Arabia (their main regional rival), and guarantee their safety against other Arab nations with whom they have historically had rocky relations (Iraq, for example).\\n2. If Israel can illegally possess nuclear weapons (they haven't officially acknowledge they have nuclear weapons, nor have they signed the UN's non-proliferation treaty, making the weapons they do possess illegal), why can't Iran possess nuclear weapons, other than Western bias? Pakistan has nuclear weapons, and they are officially an Islamic Republic, and they can have nuclear weapons, even though their nuclear weapons are probably much more of a global security risk. \\n\\n3. Iran has proven itself to be a pragmatic and rational actor in world affairs. There is no reason to suspect that they would actually use a nuclear weapon, nor sell it to a terrorist group who would. They mainly want a nuclear weapon to secure their military position in the region, stick it to their rivals, and as a point of national pride. Because the West says Iran can't have a nuclear weapon, they want one all the more, and won't back down on that because of national pride, something an American should be able to sympathize with. \\n\\nNow, I recognize that Iran should not have nuclear weapons because it would cause an arms race in the most volatile region on Earth, but that doesn't mean that they, as a sovereign nation, do not have the right to develop a nuclear weapon. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Like... six to twelve cans per day.  I rarely drink any regular soda with calories.  In fact, I grew up with diet soda and I tend to prefer the diet soda taste to regular soda.  Because of my amount of intake, I\\'ve spent a lot of time researching all of the facets of the issue, and I\\'ve found that the studies which condemn diet soda and/or aspartame are few and far between.  This is in direct contrast to all of the literature condemning diet soda and aspartame which is *not* scholarly.  In essence, the studies tend to say it\\'s fine and the blogs tend to say it\\'s not.  I put infinitely more faith in scientific rigor.  Aspartame is one of the most-studied compounds on the planet, and dozens (hundreds?) of nations have given it the okay.\\n\\nThere is likely a correlation between obesity and diet soda drinkers, however I think it\\'s pretty obvious that causality is mixed up, here.  I think that 1) people who are obese are more likely to drink diet soda as a \"diet\", and 2) people tend to order a diet soda along with a bunch of fast food or otherwise unhealthy food.  It\\'s about the lifestyle which some live, not the diet soda itself.  I\\'m not interested in lifestyle, just the diet soda itself.\\n\\nSome say that it ruins your teeth, but in the studies I\\'ve read they were testing people who already had poor oral hygiene.  I think that pretty much gives it away right there.  Additionally, I may only be a sample size of one, but I\\'ve had a lot of diet soda every day for years now, and I haven\\'t had a cavity since before puberty.  Again, it\\'s anecdotal, but it\\'s something.\\n\\nPlease give me an argument, not just a link to a study.  I\\'ve read studies linked with regards to this topic before, and there is almost always some flaw, such as a diet soda drinker who already had poor oral hygiene, the drinker already being obese, or the behavior only being shown in rats.  **I\\'d like something that says that otherwise healthy people become unhealthy solely because of diet soda and/or aspartame, not the lifestyle which surrounds it.**\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the \"not one of us\" (pack) mentality and escalation of \"police state\".\\nChange my view.\\n\\nPS: I am not here to talk about USA and its gun problems.\\n\\nEDIT: Awarded a delta to a comment which didn\\'t refute this idea but led me to change my view that it would be best realized with paralyzing weapons rather then guns: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rnr30/cmv_i_think_the_paris_shooting_makes_a_good_case/cni3o83\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Whether this attack was directly provoked by a printed image of Muhammad or not, my argument will be framed as if it were. I\\'ll paraphrase some of my posts in other threads:\\n\\nThe problem I have with this is that non-Muslims came out of the blue to offend Muslims on this particular issue. There\\'s no honor in that, we\\'re not on any sort of moral high ground.\\n\\nConsider this hypothetical: Previously, there was no issue with freedom of expression. Then Some Guy learns that many Muslims forbid printed images of their prophet. Guy says, \"hey, wouldn\\'t it be *just hilarious* if we *printed an image of their prophet*??\" So Guy prints image of their prophet. Angry terrorist coward shoots and kills Guy. Guy\\'s friends call him a martyr, cry censorship. Except there is no censorship, freedom of expression still exists 100%, Guy\\'s publication and others can and likely will post more of these images in the future. \\n\\nIf a group of people is encroaching upon your rights or beliefs then by all means defend yourself as appropriate. And as I understand it, many Muslim factions are indeed doing that around Europe and there is no insignificant amount of tension. But in this particular instance, *we kindof started it.* We created an issue where there was none.\\n\\nFreedom of expression does not imply freedom from consequences. SHOULD murder be the consequence? *Absolutely not.* However, what *should be* in this world and *what are* are two completely different things; so, we fight battles to turn the \"what ares\" into the \"should bes.\" Is the battle to print images of Muhammad, among human trafficking and rape and all the other issues, really one we need to be fighting, really worth losing lives over? I guess for some, maybe. I wonder how that policeman and his family feel about it. \\n\\nSo now, we created a situation where 1) we defend freedom of speech at high cost and continue to print things like this, or 2) we censor ourselves and the turrists win. It\\'s a situation born of childishness that has now ended in tragedy and left us with a difficult path forward. The \"point\" that now exists to be made did not exist before our initial and unprovoked challenge to Muslim beliefs. And in the name of what, *satire*? \\n\\n\\n**EDIT: I appreciate all the responses, a handful of you have given some great discussion. However I\\'m getting mired and confused in trying to keep up with and remain thoughtful in my responses, so I am taking a break to reflect and collect.

The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds, in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light.\\n\\nBut far and away, this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles: yesterday\\'s [atheism post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rfea1/) used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP, if you read that post, was by and large not interested in changing his opinion, and this is true of the *vast majority* of posts that come through here.\\n\\nAnd the problem is this: it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times, the posts are not controversial: they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places, a million internet hits, which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesm/religion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday.

But on issues that can be solved via Google search or the opening of a book, how can one fill the infinite pit of human stupidity? Only controversial issues, where both opinions are agreed to be at least understandable and held widely by educated people, should be allowed.

I realize my view is possibly more of an ideal, but places truly looking to educate their students should acknowledge the true reason for prerequisites and search for better alternatives. \\n\\nI am mainly going to look at prerequisites being enforced at publicly-funded Universities and high-schools, and will share a few real examples I've encountered with friends over the years here:\\n\\nCase 1: Friend in high school cannot apply to an Architecture program because she lacks Grade 12 Physics (and Grade 11 Physics, which is the prerequisite). It is first semester of twelfth grade for her, but she has two other necessary Math courses conflicting in time with the only 2 offerings of Grade 11 Physics courses at her school. She will now have to take Grade 11 Physics elsewhere on top of her normal schooling (but must still remain a full-time student to apply to the Universities). This will cost her both time and money unnecessarily when she can herself try to learn the material for Grade 11 Physics independently, and if asked, write an exam to take Grade 12 Physics in the second semester, which will actually give her a chance to join the Architecture program (assuming only Grade 12 marks are looked at for admission). Unfortunately, she cannot do this by school guidelines, and now has to take an accelerated Grade 11 and 12 course privately on top of her normal school schedule. \\n\\nCase 2: Friend wants to take a Cell Biology and Biochemistry course out of pure interest and also because he can use it to complete his degree. He's taken 1st-year Biology, but not 1st-year Chemistry, and can thus not enrol in Biochemistry. Biochemistry is also a prerequisite for Cell Biology, and by not taking 1st-year Chemistry, he cannot enrol in either course. I have taken 1st-year Chemistry, and can attest to how little it was used in these courses. All of the concepts could easily be understood and students could have done well with minimal Chemistry knowledge (and some did). They are both 2nd-year Biochemistry and Cell Biology courses, and all of the Chemistry handled was incredibly basic (high school Chemistry would be more than sufficient) or was already taught in the 1st-year Biology course. In this case, he simply had not the time nor money to enrol in 1st-year Chemistry, and was thus restricted from enrolling in Biochemistry or Cell Biology. Even after requesting special permission and trying to prove his background and asking the profs for the necessary Chemistry background, he was denied. \\n\\nCase 3: A 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course requires a 2nd-year DE course. I will say that DE is an integral part of the course and for a student lacking this knowledge, they will fall behind and do poorly. I also have a friend whom could not take the 2nd-year DE course with me because he would have to overload and it would be quite costly. Nonetheless, he learned the DE content on his own time when he could over the summer break and weekends. Heck, he probably went over more concepts in DE than we did in our 1 semester class. But, because he did not take this specific course, he cannot take the 3rd-year Quantum Mechanics course, thus pushing him back with his coursework. He will be taking the DE course, but only in the future and only because it is a part of the degree requirements. If a student wants to learn something earlier and they are confident in their background, why stop them? \\n\\nNow special permission can sometimes be obtained for enrolment from the course coordinator, but more often that not (from my experience) this is not the case and only happens in extreme circumstances. In the above cases, my friends all asked for special permission and were denied without even a chance to prove they have a sufficient background to keep up with the class (and possibly excel).  \\n\\nStudents should be in charge of their own education. If institutions want to (strongly) suggest a few other courses or materials ahead of time or possibly require a passing grade on a entrance test, sure, let them do that to ensure the class goes at an appropriate level. \\n\\nI also just want to clarify that I believe anti-requisites are very important for courses.\\n\\nEDIT: A student taking the course should not interfere with the University's right to confer them a degree if they've not completed the appropriate prerequisites for the degree itself. If two courses are necessary for the degree, the student must complete them. No privilege is given for taking the course itself. I am talking about why they cannot simply enrol in the course. That's it. My views are idealistic, but there certainly can be improvements at very little expense.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

In case one is not familiar currently the minimum wage is passed into passed as an hourly figure into law. To update the figure it requires another law to amend the older one. The Federal Government sets a minimum wage which is a universal minimum for all businesses operating within the United States. Individual states may opt to raise the minimum wage above that level if they wish.\\n\\nHard coding the minimum wage into law in this way is inefficient and usually damaging to most parties involved. Political parties and politicians suffer because it distracts them from working on other issues which may be more important, forcing them to make what should be trivial adjustments and sets up a perpetually recurring fight. Depending on which party has control of the house, senate, and white house it may be impossible to get any legislation through congress or the state level of government for years at a time. To get the minimum wage raised requires a large amount of political capital because it is such a controversial issue. Raising the minimum wage is a zero sum game with one of the two parties benefiting from action or lack of it. Due to this it is a toxic subject to breech in congress.\\n\\nWorkers suffer from the fighting in congress because for long periods of time they experience either low or no wage increases meaning that for many years their income does not keep track with the rate of inflation. Because of this they may not be able to buy the things they need with their paycheck thus defeating the point of minimum wage.\\n\\nBusinesses suffer because they have uncertainty over their labor costs from the fighting. While they may get savings due to declining wages relative to purchasing power in the long term they have to worry about not only the demands of the labor market but also the uncertainty of who will win a given election and what the political priorities of the newly elected majority will be. This creates uncertainty and may cause employers to delay hiring decisions and postpone growth.\\n\\nIn short there aren't many people who truly win with the way we currently adjust minimum wage. One of the key problems with the current system is we don't give bureaucrats the authority to do their job. It is the ultimate in micromanagement literally requiring an act of congress to do anything. This is a systemic issue in almost all areas of the federal government but it's especially acute here. At it's core congress should only focus on the big picture. It should be Congress' job to decide if there should be a minimum wage or not and set guidelines for what level it should be set at and the job of the executive branch to decide how much the exact numbers should be.\\n\\n**The Cost of Labor**\\n\\nMinimum wage is a CMV in and of itself and has been discussed in many other threads on this sub in the past. **I don't want people to argue about whether or not there should be a minimum wage in this thread or the specific figure that the minimum wage should be.** The assumptions and limitations here are to limit what would invariably be off topic debates, I want to discuss this specific issue and not a broader one. Let's just go with the assumption that the existence of a minimum wage is a given and getting rid of it is not an option.\\n\\nThe greatest benefit to a minimum wage is that if someone is able to get a job and get enough hours to work full time they will have enough money that to support themselves without having to rely on public assistance. At the risk of being overly simplistic the key idea is that there is a given minimum amount of money that a person must spend every month to stay alive. There is a higher amount of money that a person must spend to have what society would consider an acceptable standard of living. If someone does not have the money to pay these costs then they will either eventually die and/or live in substandard conditions unless an outside force intervenes. Let's also assume that a person has no way of getting resources other than buying them at fair market value and can't grow, steal, beg, or barter for them.\\n\\nIf the we as a society decide that we should not let people die for lack of money, then the only way for them to get the resources they need is for everyone else who has money to pay a portion of their earnings in taxes. The taxes are then used to purchase these resources for the individuals that don't have the ability to buy them for themselves.\\n\\nIf you allow businesses to pay people less than what it costs for one person to afford these resources then you are shifting the cost of supporting that person from the owners of the business to everybody in society. This is unfair because the business is the one that is benefiting from the labor of this individual yet they are not paying market value for it. As such it should be able to establish that the amount of money necessary for self-sufficiency is the basic cost of human capital.\\n\\nThis makes more sense when you think of labor in the same way you would think of other commodities. If you were to take a crop such as coffee and allow farmers to lease or buy land at below market value then the price of coffee wouldn't be accurate. I don't think most people would think it would be fair to expect other people to pay for the farmer's land.\\n\\n**The Proposed Solution**\\n\\nWe have hopefully established that there is a basic cost for human capital. To calculate what the cost is for human labor all one would need to do is add up the costs necessary to buy the basic resources every year and then divide by the number of given working hours in a year. As above I would like to request that people not argue about the exact definitions of what should be included in the definition of necessary resources and how many hours is fair to work in a week, those are all debates for other CMVs.\\n\\nThis should theoretically be very easy but we here we run into another problem with the minimum wage. Not all areas have equal costs of living and thus the cost of necessary resources is dependant entirely on where you are located and what the lowest cost for those goods in that area is. This changes on not only a city by city basis but also on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis within a city. You could have millions of different answers for minimum wages dependant on many different factors.\\n\\nTo simplify this we could group similar areas into different regions and run this calculation for each. This approach would make more sense for businesses because they could make more efficient decisions about where they should hire labor from based on the cost of living. For higher paying jobs they already do this, but this could see an explosion of jobs in low cost areas due to the low minimum wage. One of the core principles of economics is that incentives matter. If costs aren't accurate then the decisions that companies make will be biased and it will result in a more inefficient allocation of resources.\\n\\nThe next thing you would need to address is how do you get the data on the cost of living. For the most part we are already collecting this data for the consumer price index. The CPI would not be useful for this however because it includes data on all things in the economy, not just the basic resources needed to maintain life. To get this right you would need to create a new price index specifically for the minimum wage.\\n\\nAdditionally prices constantly change, that is the reason for automatic updates to the minimum wage to begin with. If you had the data you could update the minimum wage as frequently as desired. Practically speaking however, changing the minimum wage frequently would create a compliance nightmare for businesses and regulators. To reduce this burden making it so the minimum only adjusts on longer timescales is more beneficial. The best approach here is likely to update the minimum wage on an annual basis.\\n\\nTo offset variations in market prices and within regions as well as the risk of having incomplete or faulty data it would only make sense that the minimum wage has some sort of padding on top of it as a margin of error. As an initial estimate I would assume this margin of error would somewhere between 1.5% and 7%, because the rates of inflation are usually between 2%-3% within a given calendar year. However the exact number of course could be adjusted based on data and you would need to determine how variable prices and the commonality of errors to find the optimum value. Developing a formula would allow you to make minimum wages dynamically adjust based on the previous year's volatility or specific conditions in a certain region. When calculating margins of error it would likely be better to err on the side of a higher wage than a lower one.\\n\\n(**tl;dr**) What you'd end up with is:\\n\\nMinimum Hourly Wage = ( Regional Minimum Wage Price Index for Year / Full Time Working Hours per Year ) * ( 1 + Padding Margin Percentage )\\n\\n**Previous attempts at this idea**\\n\\nIn the 1970s during the period of double digit inflation rates this idea was floated by the Democrat party and made significant headway but received substantial opposition because of the high interest rates and the fear that these would remain for a long period of time.\\n\\nEdit: /u/srak has pointed out that this has existed in Belgium since 1919.\\n\\nFeel free to point out any problems you see in the idea of the minimum cost of human capital since this is essential to the promise that the wages should automatically adjust. Without that assumption everything else doesn't make any sense. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

What this has led to is a police culture of being able to take a human life at the first sign that an officer\\'s life is in danger, even remotely. \\n\\nIf a person is actually committed to being a benevolent protector of the public, he or she should be willing to take a greater personal risk in being that protector. It is my view that many officers should be disarmed of the ability to use lethal force - guns should only be carried under circumstances in which there is an actual chance of having to draw them in a fight for one\\'s life i.e. police are going after a known dangerous individual. \\n\\nThis would undoubtedly lead to an increase in officers not being able to brandish a lethal weapon in situations where they previously would have. Some police officers would die where they wouldn\\'t have before. But many fewer unnecessary civilian deaths would occur. In my opinion, cops being lethally armed and authorized to take lethal action whenever they feel threatened is not worth the cost we have been witnessing where many avoidable civilian deaths occur.\\n\\nI think it is somewhat tragic that carrying a gun is what in many ways defines what an American police officer is - someone with the ability to kill at any time should they feel it is necessary. In an ideal world where our culture did not dictate that police carry guns I think it would be great if every morning individual officers made a reasonable choice as to whether or not they would need a gun that day for whatever reason. Unfortunately this culture could not exist in America today.\\n\\nObviously in place of guns I would have increased use of tazers, not just the short-range handheld kind but also the adapted shotgun models that reach a range similar to that of a gun. Rubber bullets would also be acceptable. \\n\\nMy main point is that cops should be taking a greater personal risk in serving the public as our current system of valuing police life above the citizenry is what has led to such endemic unnecessary police violence.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

(Ex. *Event A will cause Event B.*)\\n\\n- **Indeterminism** : No event is certain, and the entire outcome of an event is based on probability, or **chance**. (Ex. *Event A might cause Event B or Event C.*)\\n\\n**BACKGROUND** \\n\\nAfter the 18th century, most scientists agreed that the universe was deterministic, that it was governed by strict scientific laws that could be discovered and applied to determine the outcome of any event. Thus, determinism seems to challenge the possibility of free will. If one accepts determinism, then the universe, and any person in it, is governed by strict scientific laws. This means that any event, including an individual\\'s choices could be determined based on scientific knowledge and causality, or cause-and-effect. However, advancements in quantum mechanics challenged determinism, ultimately proposing a universe that follows general scientific laws but one which does not have a predetermined future.\\n\\nIt was Werner Heisenberg who discovered indeterminism within the measurement of basic variables. Heisenberg\\'s experiments and analysis showed that uncertainties always occurred when attempting to measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. Heisenberg concluded that these uncertainties or imprecisions in the measurements were fundamental in the universe and are inherent mathematical properties in quantum mechanics. Voila! Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the basis for quantum tunneling and how nuclear fusion occurs in stars.\\n\\n**MY VIEW / PERSONAL**\\n\\nI am a twenty-five year old nuclear engineer, and as you probably guessed it, I work at a nuclear power plant. I spend a lot of time thinking about philosophy, from a scientific standpoint. This past weekend, I had the wonderful privilege of going on a series of dates with a rather remarkably intelligent, and beautiful, young woman. To my surprise, after a few drinks, we were discussing very riveting topics, one of which based around **\"Free Will\"**. We both agreed that chemistry and physics define the universe around us, and since humans are made of matter, we are also governed by those scientific laws as well. If this is truly the case, humans exist in a deterministic universe where everything can be predicted, even our decisions... given enough scientific knowledge. Conclusion: \"Free-Will\" is an illusion.\\n\\nNow, fast-forward to two days later. I\\'m still thinking about the discussion and bending my mind around any way to disprove my theory scientifically. (I personally love to play Devil\\'s Advocate to my own theories.) I haven\\'t been able to, and actually, I\\'ve further convinced myself of it. I started digging around in a lot of my quantum physics books, and in combination with reading a good deal of philosophy, I have come to the following conclusions:\\n\\n- 1) Our universe is indeterminate. When considering the wave-particle duality of matter, I am fairly convinced that the universe is not determinate, or at least \"nearly\" indeterminate if specific events are not possible in this universe.\\n\\n- 2) What do I mean by \"nearly\" indeterminate? Perhaps, specific events appear determinate due to a system in which certain events cannot occur, thus forcing a determinate solution from an indeterminate system.\\n\\nIf I believe that the universe is indeterminate, everything is a matter of chance. In short, *Event A probabilistically causes Event B or Event C.* However, the presence of Event C doesn\\'t imply Event A happened. Also, the presence of Event A doesn\\'t imply Event B or Event C will happen. Infact, there is the potential that nothing could happen if the sum of the probabilities of Events B and C doesn\\'t equal 1.\\n\\nSo what does this all mean? \\n\\n**I believe that our universe is governed by indeterminism. This means that the future is not necessarily constrained to a single course. However, I believe that the probability of certain events occurring is zero, and thus appears to be deterministic. For example, if I throw my phone directly over my head, gravity will cause it to fall directly on my head. There is no other outcome, as the probability of gravity acting as the driving force is absolute. The event is trivial. I believe the same is true for chemical reactions, that they will behave in what appears to be a deterministic manner to do an \"absolute\" outcome. Thus, I would state that while our universe is indeterminate, we still do lack \"Free-Will\". Or, perhaps our understanding of energy and matter is wrong, and what appears indeterminate within our current understanding is determinate in a different scientific field.**\\n\\nPlease, provide any opinions or insight you have. I\\'ve been thinking on this topic non-stop and want to know what Reddit thinks. I understand that this topic has been discussed here, but more importantly, I am aiming to address the following in regard to my view, **\"Is it possible that we live in an indeterminate universe where events are left to chance, but we, as humans still lack Free-Will?\"**\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

[ (Not from the movie, but from here) ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=sa7rmohv1hmgymf4xdu8cait&amp;page=27#660) It summed up my feelings about the movie quite well. Throughout human history, conquerors with superior technology have succeeded over less capable and less innovative cultures. It's ruthless, yes, but the reality is conquered cultures were less capable than the victors. Therefor it is in the best interest of cultures to strive for innovation, invention, progress, technology, and science. Not only does this secure survivability, but also increases standard of living.\\n\\nColonel Quaritch, as well as the other miners, were there to extract resources which benefited this endeavor. They were striving to better their abilities through use of the metal under the tree the Na'vi inhabited. \\n\\nArguably, Colonel Quaritch **COULD** have massacred the residents of Hometree. It was well within his ability and means. Instead, a chance to evacuate is given, and Quaritches forces **target Hometree itself, not the Na'vi** The fleet do not gun down the fleeing residents, nor do they pursue. Their goal was the resources under the tree, and not the extermination of the people.\\n\\n\\nNext, Quaritch ceases hostilities against the Na'vi until Jake assembles a massive force around the headquarters. Quaritch **COULD** have met them in battle, but instead what does he do? Tries to avoid direct bloodshed by taking out a cultural symbol, thus potentially avoiding loss of life among both Na'vi and Human. \\n\\n\\nThe culture of the Na'vi could have ended up like the Native Americans. Conquered, but preserved through merciful reservations granted by the victors. Instead they opted for resistance, and I'm interested to see what the sequel holds for them. In the mean time, I feel Colonel Quaritch's actions were rational, reasonable, justifiable, and the correct course of action. My friend disagreed, and I'm more than open for discussion to better understand the opposing view.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Edit 3 basically perfectly describes the whole situation.\\n\\n\\nI really wanna talk more about this. Surely I\\'m missing something. I have three major issues:\\n\\n1. You\\'re screwing the kid over, plain and simple. Mommy and Daddy make $100,000/year and don\\'t wanna pay for college, you are quite simply screwed.\\n\\n2. The only reasonable way to become independent is to get married or pregnant. Are we really going to encourage 18-24 year olds to get married and have kids? That\\'s the most unstable part of your young adult life.\\n\\n3. People aren\\'t stupid, they see this flaw. You are creating a drift between the socioeconomic classes because poor people get $5,500+ a year and middle class people don\\'t. \"You just got that money because you\\'re poor.\" \"I wish my parents were poor!\" I hear this shit all the time.\\n\\nThese are some basic arguments because I feel like I\\'m missing a big piece of this scenario and hopefully all the clouds will part after I am enlightened.\\n\\n**Edit:** Well, I\\'ve only had reasons added to my list.\\n\\n4. This places potentially life crippling debt on a person who falls into the category I\\'m describing. You could ruin someones life over how much their parent makes.\\n\\n5. To go with that, a student has no control over their parents, and thus really no control over their FAFSA. Yet we award them based on it.\\n\\n6. To top that piece off, you cause psychological distress by awarding some people and not others over what is basically random chance. A student simply cannot control such aspects of their life.\\n\\nIf we will award a low income student due to their uncontrolled aspects of life, why will we then turn around and deny a middle class student awards due to their uncontrolled aspects of life?\\n\\n**Edit 2:**\\n\\n1. This allows your parents to control your life a lot. They might hold money over your head and force a career on you.\\n\\n**Edit 3:** /u/carasci has pretty much perfectly summed up my thoughts on this (sorry I\\'m just getting really tired, I was pretty tired in the first place and didn\\'t expect this to get much attention. I honestly expected someone to point out a humongous flaw in my thinking and then I\\'d be handy dandy, but nope!)\\n\\n&gt;What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents. This workaround doesn\\'t have to be easy, and you can force them to prove the lack of support. This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member. This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation. Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn\\'t have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets. (If there are a very small number of them extending help won\\'t affect what\\'s available to others; if there are a very large number of them they\\'re a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)\\nTo some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed. However, there\\'s a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren\\'t insignificant. FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it\\'s a relatively small amount. Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else\\'s dime), but in doing so they\\'d be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the only assistance their kid was getting. My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won\\'t be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.\\nIs all of this more work for FAFSA? Sure, but as you\\'ve mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.\\nBasically, I\\'m not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn\\'t be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students. Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\\n\\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is pretty much exactly what I\\'m after.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Fucking pointless and borderline disrespectful to the developers (I\\'ll admit this last part is a bit dubious, but, well...they did work to put it in the game as a main function of the game and it makes up a good portion of their creative output. It\\'s kinda lame to just ignore that aspect of it).\\n\\nEDIT: This part of my view has also been changed.\\n\\n**3. Not only do items not hinder the competitive aspect of the game; they add to it, making their restriction the hindrance.**\\n\\nThis is the big one. This is why competitive Smash players leave items off in the first place: Because \"the random aspect makes the game less competitive\". Um...how? I mean, I guess the justification is that the randomness of item types and placement reduces the focus on the players\\' abilities, but to that I say two things:\\n\\n**3A. No, it doesn\\'t remove focus on players\\' abilities.**\\n\\nDo you not even consider that, y\\'know, the person who gets the item still has to use it *correctly*? And you can still dodge it? And, assuming the item doesn\\'t spawn right next to a player, you still have to make the dash to the item before someone else ***OR*** decide not to go for it at all. This is where the game becomes *more* competitive with the use of items. You have to actually take them into account. I imagine a common argument against items is something like \"oh well you suck if you can only win with items on.\" Have you considered that maybe *you* suck because you can\\'t win without them turned off?\\n\\nI guess what I\\'m saying here is that while items add a slight element of chance, they more than make up for it with a multiple separate aspects of player skill.\\n\\n**3B. Even if there is a random aspect to the game...so what?**\\n\\nIt\\'s not as though it\\'s a coin toss or a lottery where it\\'s based entirely on luck. It\\'s just the kinds of items and where they\\'re placed. The addition of luck is part of the fun *and* part of the challenge.\\n\\nLuck and competition are not mutually exclusive. Even with items turned off. It\\'s not even possible for them to be. There\\'s always going to be the possibility of an otherwise champion player making a stupid, fatal fuckup, or a glitch in the game causing an otherwise unwarranted victory. I understand wanting to reduce that element of chance, but removing items does so to the point that the fun in the competition is lost.\\n\\nAt the very least, there should be separate, mainstream Smash tournaments that keep items on.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The term was used to plot a persons learning over their experience (see example [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alanf777_Lcd_fig02.png)).  The example here shows how a person rapidly gains proficiency (or learning) and eventually levels off.  This could be a representations of how a person learns some thing easy, like tic-tac-toe.  Note here that the curve is quite steep, ie the slope is very large (a large change in y over a small change in y).  [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alanf777_Lcd_fig08.png) is a comparison between a steep (in red) and a shallow (in blue) curve.  The shallow curve means that proficiency (or learning) is gained more slowly over time compared to the steep curve.\\n\\nNow words are often used differently in science and in common parlance, theory is a good example.  In common parlance theory means a guess, whereas in science theory means a body of knowledge including all known facts, hypotheses, and natural laws relevant to a particular field of study or  a proposed explanation of a set of related facts or a given phenomenon.  In general, when the term \"steep learning curve\" is used in common parlance it used to describe something difficult to learn.  Eg \"The video game Dark Souls has a very steep learning curve\".  What this sentence is meant to convey is that the game is hard to learn and master, which is clearly described by a shallow learning curve, not a steep one.\\n\\nIn conclusion saying \"This game is hard, it has a steep learning curve\" is equivalent to saying \"I could care less\" when what one meant was \"I couldn\\'t care less\"'},\n {'title': 'CMV: Nobody who works in a cubicle or other job where you rarely interact with anyone other than your co-workers should have any dress code beyond \"cover your naughty bits\" and \"don\\'t wear offensive stuff\"',\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2r4u3k',\n  'selftext': 'To be clear: I\\'m talking about research/design/programming/IT/call center jobs, where you aren\\'t in the public eye or aren\\'t representing the company with your physical body.

I don\\'t view Connery\\'s Bond as a performance that was so definitive that the other actors paled in comparison.  Three reasons.\\n\\n**1. Connery\\'s acting quality declined over the years.**\\n\\nHis first three performances (Dr. No, From Russia With Love and Goldfinger) were excellent.  But when we get to You Only Live Twice, it was visibly apparent that he was tired and stressed.  By Diamonds Are Forever, he looked old, fat, and totally uninterested in the role.  Let\\'s not even get to Never Say Never Again.\\n\\nBrosnan maintained the same performance throughout all of his films.  He was consistent.  Even at the old age of 57, Moore was in good shape and had his heart in the role.  For Craig, Quantum of Solace was considered a weak film, but his acting in it was acclaimed.  \\n\\n**2. Connery\\'s portrayal of the character didn\\'t eclipse the other actors**\\n\\nTo say that Connery \"IS James Bond\" or that he\\'s the definitive one would suggest that his role was basically a complete exhaustive interpretation of everything 007 could ever be.  The fact that 007 became a franchise for 40 years after Connery proved that he wasn\\'t the only one who could move the character.\\n\\nEach of the other actors brought something new to the table.  Lazenby\\'s Bond was human, emotional and empathetic.  Moore\\'s Bond did plenty of new outrageous creative things which gave him his own fan base.  Dalton\\'s dark primal take on Bond was a dramatic shift as well.  Brosnan established himself as a refined modern man, as well as a suave gentleman.  And Craig re-invented Bond as a vulnerable soul who rises above his troubles.\\n\\n**3. Connery\\'s portrayal of the character wasn\\'t accurate to the books.**\\n\\nConnery\\'s interpretation of Bond misses the point of the books.\\n\\nWith Fleming\\'s books, the emphasis was less about who the character of James Bond was, and moreso the feeling you get when you read about his adventures.  Unlike Connery\\'s performance which deliberately sought out to make Bond himself the most interesting part.\\n\\nBond is a manifestation of Fleming\\'s desires.  Bond doesn\\'t womanize because he\\'s fun.  He womanizes because there\\'s a void in his heart and he can\\'t hold a relationship.  Bond smokes and drinks to alleviate his stress.  Bond kills because he has to.  Connery established Bond as a guy every man wanted to be, but we don\\'t want to be Fleming\\'s Bond.\\n\\nConnery was partly responsible for making the series so popular.  There is nothing wrong with Bond being interpreted liberally.  I have no problem with Moore defusing a bomb in a clown suit, so I have no problem with Connery having a sugarcoated Bond either.  The problem is when a certain sect of Connery\\'s fanbase asserts the Connery is the true James Bond, when he is just an interpretation.  Moore was honest that his portrayal was goofy, whereas with Connery there was a pretense that he was actually the character.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The hopeful trend of convergence brought about by fast emerging-market growth from 2000 to 2007 has reversed:https://www.credit-suisse.com/upload/news-live/000000022801.pdf Emerging markets, while creating a ton of GDP, are not converting much of that to wealth and the US has actually *increased* its share of global wealth since 2007, with all of that going to the top. As a result, the average human being is poorer now than she was in 2010, even though global income and wealth as an aggregate have increased substantially. The median American is poorer than the median Canadian or even Italian and is at about the same wealth level as a Portuguese, a South Korean, or a Western Slav. Chillingly, much of Western Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel are following on the same track.\\n\\nIt is easy to see the links between high inequality and low mobility in the US, as well as increasing global inequality that is wiping out the gains China and other emerging countries made in the 2000-2007 period, and various US and international problems.\\n\\nPolice brutality has proven to be among the most effective wedge issues keeping desperate black and Hispanic Americans from solidarity with slightly less desperate white Americans.\\n\\nGun control has repeatedly been blocked by desperate white Americans voting in the Tea Party, by mistrust of the government, and, as Obama pointed out in 2008, clinging to firearm ownership as one of their few sources of power. At the same time, highly-armed but equal societies like Switzerland and Iceland have far less gun violence (and non-gun violence) than the US.\\n\\nEducation reform is futile when 20-30% of the American population is struggling to make ends meet and 70%+ are one unlucky break or bad decision away from misery. At the same time, many Americans are not seeing any return in education and are taking out tens of thousands in student loans only to work at Starbucks or McDonald\\'s. If the sons and daughters of the USA\\'s white upper-middle-class are struggling to stay afloat, what does that say about the chances and return on investment for the white working class, much less blacks and Hispanics in the inner cities?\\n\\nAmerican football will forever retain a steady pipeline of recruits so long as poor blacks, Hispanics, and rural folk see no path to college or wealth other than combat sports. Many parts of the US see gridiron football as their main lifeline and source of charity and economic activity.\\n\\nEurope has long been spared the extremes of capitalism in the American style; however, the ongoing economic crisis has resulted in parties left, right, and center in countries with credit ratings from AAA to junk making cuts in government programs and benefits that would have been political suicide just one decade earlier. This phenomenon has spread to Canada, Australia, and even New Zealand and Japan and in the Northern countries is accompanied by a housing bubble in major cities that results in crippling household-debt-to-GDP ratios, years of \"hidden homelessness\" and couch-surfing in cities like Stockholm, and near-US-like levels of wealth inequality. With no mainstream politicians willing to reject austerity, this Great Americanization has been a boon to far-left and far-right parties, including close allies of Vladimir Putin, as well as to conversions to radical Islam.\\n\\nThe situation in Israel is similar. Ultranationalism has become a handy distraction from Israelis\\' day-to-day problems and antipathy that should be directed at the elite is instead being directed at the Palestinians. At the same time, the rise of radical Islamic groups such as ISIS that make the Taliban and al-Qaeda look like teddy bears has colored a lot of the anti-Palestinian and anti-Arab rhetoric, as have alliances of convenience with ex-neo-Nazis in the European far right.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For example: 'That's so gay' and 'You throw like a girl' type insults. Many people come to the conclusion that these type of insults are homophobic and misogynistic, but I don't believe that's necessarily the case at all.\\n\\nI think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity. He is being called something he is not. He doesn't think its insulting because he hates girls and thinks they're inferior, but rather because his identity as a boy is being taken away.\\n\\nWomen in general also hate being associated with masculinity. They tend to want to be smaller than their partners because they feel masculine if they are taller. They religiously pluck facial hair and shave away body hair because that's manly. But they probably don't hate men.\\n\\nSimilarly, being called gay is a huge insult to many guys not because they are all homophobic, but because they are being called something they are not.\\n\\nI think the best way to see it from my point of view is looking at how offensive it is for trans people when they are mis-gendered (Purposely).

Feminists often try to silence women's criticisms of feminism by saying they have internalized misogyny. I don't believe this is the case. A lack of belief in the patriarchy can be caused by the lack of empirical evidence. Examples of misogyny and discrimination don't have to be ignored or excused (as one with internalized misogyny would be expected to do) because they do not necessarily prove the existence of a patriarchy, nor institutional misogyny. Saying a woman has internalized misogyny discredits her experience of what may be a lack of being victimized. Telling a woman she's a victim when she's not is belittling.

For an incredibly cheap price, or sometimes at no price at all, you can listen to almost any song your heart desires, or watch any movie that strikes your interest. Yes, it is true that both of these services do not have literally everything, but as the years go on, these services will only get better, to the point where it is virtually impossible to not have access to a movie or song.\\n\\n2) Storage devices will only continue to increase in storage capacity.

December 25, 1 BC), popularized in Western Europe as the dominant era system throughout the latter half of the first millennium and cemented as the de facto year system by the mid-20th century, even in non-Western nations. The acronym most familiarly used to denote the current year and distinguish it from years going back over 2,014 years ago is \"AD\", standing for *Anno Domini*, a Latin phrase translating to \"In the Year of the Lord\". The term most often used to denote years prior to 2,014 years ago is \"BC\", standing for Before Christ, a direct English-language reference.\\n\\nBut in academia, the scientific community and elsewhere there is an increased tendency to favor the usage of \"BCE\" (Before Common Era) to replace BC, and \"CE\" (Common Era) to replace AD. This is claimed to be used for several reasons, all of which I disagree with (from arguments I\\'ve seen so far). Please CMV regarding any or all of these points, or any other points you may think of.\\n\\nHere\\'s my responses to the common arguments:\\n\\n-----\\n     Jesus Christ was not really born at the epoch of this calendrical era, \\n     and using CE/BCE is more historically and scientifically appropriate.\\n-----\\n\\nWhile it is true that a historical Jesus was more likely to have been born closer to 5 BC than to 1 BC or 1 AD, this is irrelevant to the argument at hand. Does Wednesday actually “belong” to the deity Woden? No, but that’s what the name Wednesday suggests. If Jesus never existed, which is a real possibility, then he was never really born, and the epoch is based on an entirely mythical religious reference akin to an English-language day of the week. Plus the word Christ means \"Messiah\", so BC means before the Christian Messiah, not before a historical person. AD has the same implication in \"Lord\".\\n\\nBCE and CE are no more “historically appropriate” than BC and AD are. Both sets of acronyms are used to reference years within the scheme of a 6th-century attempt to date years from the birth of a Christian deity, thus having cultural significance, not scientific or historical significance. One set of acronyms directly references this origin and are the naturally-occurring terms, while the other throws all connotations out in a move that can hardly be seen as less than revisionist. “Christian Era” would have been acceptable, but “Common” makes no sense. Common to whom? Why?\\n\\nAs for BC and AD giving implicit expression to Christian-derived cultural terms, it is again no different than giving such expression to pagan terms seen in the weekdays and months, which are referenced ***far more often*** (try every single day) than BC and AD. When someone suggests changing Thor\\'s Day (\"Thursday\") to \"Common Era Weekday #4\", get back to me.\\n\\n-----\\n     Not everyone is Christian, so for non-christians it is silly to expect \\n     them to refer to a year as being 2015 AD or \"In the Year of the Lord\" \\n     when Jesus Christ is not their Lord.\\n-----\\n\\nAs mentioned, our Western calendar has days, months and years named for various historical and persisting Western religions, ranging from Christianity to Norse and Roman paganism. If a non-pagan sees nothing wrong with referring to all of the days of the week using names honoring pagan gods and god-like objects, then why is Christianity any different? The fact that Christianity is still a major religious sect should have no effect whatsoever on someone who doesn\\'t give Christianity any more credence than paganism anyhow.\\n\\n*/ENDQUESTIONS*\\n\\nAny other arguments are welcome, I\\'ll be sure to respond. My main reason for posting this is that on Reddit/the Internet in general, I often get patronizingly told to use BCE/CE instead of BC/AD when I use the latter, so I\\'m certainly interested in hearing why I\\'m wrong here, and perhaps my mind can be swayed. I know this topic is ultimately trivial, but it speaks to the heart of so many debates and arguments within our society: RELIGION and POLITICS!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So maybe there\\'s an obvious reason for there not to be such a provision that I haven\\'t considered, but here\\'s what I think:\\n\\nI know that trademarks require continued use to be demonstrated every few years in order to be maintained, but copyrights last continuously for the life of the author + 70 years regardless of whether they\\'re being used or not. While I believe that the term should definitely be shortened, that\\'s not really what I\\'m concerned with in this post.\\n\\nI\\'ve previously read that the percentage of works that remain profitable after multiple decades is in the low single-digits (I can\\'t remember the exact percentage or number of years). Thus, the vast majority of works that remain under copyright aren\\'t likely to be exploited at all for a period of many, many decades until they are finally released into the public domain (at which point they may not have nearly as much relevance, or they may not even be accessible anymore at all). I have come across this in many cases myself, in which I\\'ve found that large numbers of books are out of print and large numbers of TV shows have never been released in any purchasable format at all. In some cases, the company has even explicitly stated that the reason the shows won\\'t be released is due to the fact that it wouldn\\'t be profitable enough. So what\\'s the point of the company continuing to hold the copyright?\\n\\nSome people might argue that one right granted by copyright is the right to control when a work is released, and thus that the copyright holder has the right not to release it. But surely in the vast majority of cases, the copyright holder would be open to the work\\'s release...if it would be profitable. The Constitution states that the purpose of copyright is to promote the progress of the arts (or something like that), and if a work is being kept from the public solely for monetary reasons - with the motivation behind this decision being very unlikely to change in the future - isn\\'t the copyright actually working against the progress of the arts? Obviously there is no possibility of the work \"promoting the progress of the arts\" if the public has absolutely no way to access it, but if there was a legal way to access it, then it would at least have a chance to do so. Yet current copyright law denies this.\\n\\nTherefore, while I do believe that other changes should be made to copyright law as well, I think that requiring a copyright holder to maintain continued use of the works for which they hold the copyrights would be a good first step. So long as the works are made available to the public sufficiently often and for a sufficient amount of time, the copyright holder would continue to hold the copyright up until the maximum term length. This still benefits the copyright holder because they will surely keep releasing any work that remains profitable sufficiently often to maintain the copyright as long as possible, but also benefits the public because books, TV shows, and other media that remain out of print or unavailable for a sufficient amount of time would become public domain, allowing legal access to them for anyone who desired (access that would likely be impossible under current copyright law).\\n\\nRequiring such continued use seems as though it would be especially beneficial as more media shifts to the digital realm. It seems highly likely that very large numbers of books, and presumably large amounts of other forms of media as well, will never even be converted to a digital format due to the copyright holder simply thinking it wouldn\\'t be worth it. If continued use was required, this would either provide an additional incentive to the copyright holder to do so or allow members of the public who care about the works in question to facilitate their own digital conversions instead.\\n\\nI\\'ll admit that I could foresee some problems with this, but I believe that the positive effects would definitely outweigh any negative ones. One initial problem would simply be determining how \"continued use\" should be defined, since any term specified and language used would inevitably be fairly arbitrary. For example, I don\\'t think that making just a small number of copies available every so often or making copies only available for a short period of time every so often should count. I would suggest that the public should have the continued ability to purchase or otherwise legally obtain the works for a majority of the time within any given time period (which should probably be ~5-6 years; similar to the term for trademark law). While it might seem like a problem at first, I\\'m sure that it would be possible to figure out a satisfactory wording for such a provision, though it should be done in such a way that the term can\\'t simply be extended in the way that the copyright term itself has been repeatedly extended.\\n\\nWhat might be the most major problem I could foresee would be the impact on the secondhand media industry. While I don\\'t know for sure how large of a portion of the economy this makes up, or how many jobs are involved, it seems obvious that it could take a hit if people no longer needed to buy secondhand copies of media in order to access it. This wouldn\\'t be a problem in cases where the media has never been available for purchase in the first place (as with many TV shows), but it might be in cases where the media is simply out of print. Despite this, I still believe that a continued use provision would be a good idea. While it may negatively impact secondhand media industries, I think that it would also open up opportunities for many more industries. The additional material that would be available in the public domain would allow the public to create adaptations, derivative works, and other new media inspired by it without fear of being sued for violating the copyright on a work that the copyright holder wasn\\'t using and likely had no plans to use anyway. This seems as though it might even allow new sectors of the media industry to be created, and would surely allow it to expand at the very least. And there would surely still be some people who would want the original copies of out of print works, allowing the secondhand media industry to continue to exist in some form. However, given the continued shift to digital media and the fact that there currently is pretty much no secondhand market for digital media as far as I know, the secondhand media industry seems very likely to shrink over time regardless of any changes in copyright law, so the actual impact of a continued use provision may not be particularly large in the end after all.\\n\\nAdditionally, I suppose that there might be occasional cases in which works could return to profitability after long periods of being unprofitable and thus not being made available to the public (periods that would presumably be longer than those allowed by a continued use provision). However, as far as I know, cases such as these are quite rare and should not be viewed as a significant enough reason not to adopt a continued use provision.\\n\\nAnyway, I apologize that this is so long, but I\\'ve tried to describe my position as well as I can (though I might be able to come up with even more reasons for it if necessary) and tried to anticipate possible arguments against it as well. Again, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen anyone else suggest this as a possible solution for some of the problems with copyright law, so I\\'m genuinely interested to see whether anyone thinks this could be viable or not. Though shortening the current copyright terms (among other changes) would definitely be preferable, another extension might even be acceptable if absolutely necessary so long as a continued use provision was included as well. While some works wouldn\\'t enter the public domain for an even longer period of time, many more would be likely to enter it much sooner than they otherwise would (and those that didn\\'t would still have their availability to the public ensured), making this seem like a potentially reasonable compromise to me (if a compromise was necessary at all). If there are problems that I haven\\'t foreseen or if I\\'ve underestimated the problems that I have foreseen, then I would definitely be open to changing my view on this (though I think it\\'s very unlikely that my view that copyright law needs to be modified in general would change).\\n\\nTL;DR: Copyright law as it now stands causes most works to remain under copyright for decades without truly benefiting either the copyright holder or the public, while potentially causing works to become entirely unavailable by the time they should enter the public domain. This seems to violate the purpose of copyright as specified in the Constitution (which states that it\\'s supposed to promote the progress of the arts) because the works are being kept away from public access for purely monetary reasons (i.e. copyright holders don\\'t believe that making them available would be profitable) that are not very likely to change in the future. Adding a continued use provision (somewhat similar to that specified in trademark law) could provide an additional incentive for copyright holders to make works available to the public, and could allow works that continue to be out of print or entirely unavailable to enter the public domain before the maximum term would otherwise be up while allowing works that continue to be profitable to remain protected by copyright as long as possible. This would be especially beneficial as digital media continues to become more prevalent, since it would either encourage the copyright holder to digitize works that would otherwise not be likely to be digitized or allow the public to digitize these works themselves if the copyright holder still elects not to do so. While this might negatively impact secondhand media industries, it would surely benefit the public as a whole and would be almost certain to result in the expansion of other media industries. It may not even impact the secondhand media industry as much as it might seem as though it would, since the lack of a secondhand market for digital media seems likely to cause the secondhand media industry to shrink in the future regardless of any changes in copyright law. While there may be some cases in which works could return to profitability after long periods of not being profitable and thus having not been made available to the public, these cases are likely to be rare enough that they shouldn\\'t hinder the adoption of a continued use provision. If there are other problems that I haven\\'t foreseen, or if I\\'ve underestimated the problems that I have foreseen, then I would be open to changing my view on this.\\n\\nEdit: Minor sentence improvements.\\n\\nEdit 2: Added TL;DR.\\n\\nEdit 3: More minor sentence improvements.'},\n {'title': 'CMV: The most financially successful film released in 2014 was likely Planes: Fire and Rescue',\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2qz1fp',\n  'selftext': \"**TL;DR: Planes 2 likely made 24 times is production cost back in worldwide box office, blu-ray + dvd and merchandising. Transformers 4 (the highest grossing film worldwide) made roughly 15 times its production cost back. So, Planes 2 is the most successful film this year.**\\n\\n*****\\n\\nWhile arbitrary, I define financial success as the cumulative revenue a film is responsible for generating (box office, merchandising, secondary markets) as a multiple of its production cost. I also eliminate films costing minimal amounts of money to produce (e.g., a youtube video or independent film not in wide release).\\n\\nAs a target, the highest grossing film worldwide was Transformers: Age of Extinction, which [grossed] (http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Transformers-Age-of-Extinction#tab=summary) approximately 1.137 billion in its initial worldwide release and domestic US DVD and Blu-ray sales.  Additionally, lets assume that the film grosses another 87 million in worldwide secondary sales, and around 2 billion in merchandising in the next few years. These figures aren't public, but are based on estimates from the original trilogy published by [Variety] (http://variety.com/2014/film/news/transformers-the-anatomy-of-a-cross-platform-money-maker-1201245881/). Transformers [cost] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=transformers4.htm) $210 million to make. So, **Transformer's 4's revenue:production cost ratio is around 15.2** (3.2b:210m).\\n\\nTo beat this figure, Planes: Fire and Rescue would have to have a cumulative revenue more than $760 million (15.2 x [its production cost] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=planes2.htm) of $50 million).\\n\\nWe know that its [worldwide box office] (http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=planes2.htm) was $147 million. It [made] (http://www.the-numbers.com/weekly-video-sales-chart) 22 million in domestic US blu-ray and dvd sales. Additionally, using a traditional international dvd/blu-ray sales multipler, we can estimate roughly 35 million of international sales. So cumulatively, the film has made roughly $204 million from box office and secondary markets.\\n\\nNow, the film would have to make roughly $556 million from merchandising in order to pass Transformers 4 in revenue:production cost ratio. I would argue that this film will do so easily. Data shows that the Cars series (averaged) [http://www.cnbc.com/id/43525949]. 2 billion per year. The original Cars film made $10 billion in merchandising in 5 years (see previous cite). This $2 billion estimate was also made before Disney expanded its theme parks to include Cars-specific attractions. It is unclear if the Cars/Planes series is still generating $2/yr, and $10 billion/film. However, the merchandising channels have been plowed by former films, and Disney is primed to take advantage of the release of Planes films. So, it would not be unrealistic to think that Planes 2 would generate at least 10% of the merchandising revenue generated by Cars. If Planes 2 generates a mere 10% of the merchandising revenue that Cars 1 generated, it would generate **1.2 billion** in total box office, dvd + bluray, and merchandising. **This gives it a 24-times revenue:production cost ratio, about 1.6 times Transformers 4's ratio of 15.**\\n\\nTherefore, Planes 2 is likely the most financially successful film of the year. If its merchandising is greater than 10% of Cars 1's total, then it may have been much more successful than any other film this year.\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In fact, at some point, they become the more dominant than the market dynamics themselves.  \\n\\nEvery market has infinite frictions.\\n\\nThere is no way to model infinite frictions.\\n\\nTherefore the market model does not adequately describe the behavior of poor people.\\n\\nTherefore to describe how income distribution affects the economy, you have to abandon the market.\\n\\nEven though there are ways to model *some* frictions, the most basic macro models treat the economy as a set of efficient markets.\\n\\nSomething like game theory might not have the same inherent bias, because it wouldn\\'t have the same starting point as models using markets, so it wouldn\\'t necessarily be a classist bias.\\n\\nOf course there\\'s the argument \"but markets aren\\'t the only part of the field.\"  I\\'m not trying to get into a semantic argument about the definition of \"field.\"  And lets be real, the concept of a market is pretty much what makes economics what it is. \\n\\n*********\\n\\nYou can read all this so the comments make sense, but everything below has been pretty much hashed out.\\n\\nEvery mathematical model requires basic assumptions, and the conclusions drawn from it will be inescapably colored by those assumptions.\\n\\nIn order to say that 1 apple plus another apple is 2 apples, you have to ignore time (eventually it\\'s 0 apples) and space and all kinds of other things. Also, there are implicit definitions (\"plus\" means putting them next to each other or in the same container)\\n\\nIn economics, there seem to be base assumptions that make the math easier, but aren\\'t strictly true.  You end up with conclusions that are false.  Of course for glaring inconsistencies, the models eventually get adjusted, but there\\'s always a lag and a cost involved in refining the models, which makes it less likely to occur.  In the meantime, people latch onto those conclusions and use them for their own agenda.\\n\\nIn physics, there\\'s the ideal gas law, etc.  These tend to hold pretty accurate and be pretty precise except at the very extremes.  In economics, the \"idealized laws\" often bear very little resemblance to reality (perfect labor market?  psht).  And the precise way in which they err almost always ignores the effects on poor people, just like treating the earth as flat will tend to cause you to err on the side of overestimating distances.  Rich people tend to behave much more like the idealized laws, and so when the models get close enough to base policy off of, they tend to err in their favor.\\n\\nFor instance, due to basic macro-economic models, there is a base assumption that free trade is always better due to models which show that in the long term, there is less overall wealth generated.  However, this ignores the utility in preserving certain industries nationally, as well as incubation of industries to create a comparative advantage where one didn\\'t exist before.  Of course you can patch together something that explains this, but the math is harder, and you would never actually predict it based off of the initial model.  \\n\\nBy presuming that people make the best economic decisions when information is evenly distributed, there is an implicit corollary that people not making the best economic decisions have less information. \\n\\nSo then you have the logical conclusion giving money to charity indicates a lack of information. While not accepted and clearly wrong, it is a valid conclusion to draw from the above assumptions.  So, it has to be specifically explained away, both logically, and with extra terms in the math.\\n\\nEven worse than the conclusion about charity is the corollary that if people are poor, and haven\\'t made optimal economic decisions (i.e. become rich), then it\\'s because they haven\\'t had enough information (i.e. they haven\\'t educated themselves or are stupid).  I know that this is not what economics says, but what I\\'m saying is that it is very, very easy to say in the mathematical language of economics. \\n\\nNobody would ever say that explicitly, but the conclusions drawn from the models tend toward that because the basic mathematical templates have that bias. \\n\\nAnother fact is, economists tend to have higher-than-average incomes, so there is a selection bias in that as well.  Not that they\\'re consciously making up things to justify their relative wealth, but they lack information about real people\\'s decision-making processes, and thus will tend to err one way versus the other.  Even if an economist disagrees with some of this, they will have to take classes where they are taught what has been filtered through this system. They will be more competitive for grants and fellowships if they work within the established frameworks.\\n\\nAlternative models would just start with different assumptions, and then you could go through the same process of continuously modifying the model until it can explain something like supply and demand.  \\n\\n\\nEdit 1: it\\'s a bit irrelevant to the discussion, but this video is what I\\'m talking about with entropy: http://youtu.be/e91D5UAz-f4?t=53m53s\\n\\nEdit 2: clarifications\\n\\nEdit 3: Removed distracting side-points and examples.\\n\\nEdit 4: Rephrased argument\\n\\n_________\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It would be better to break it down further so that they are taxed 10% on the first $30k, 15% on the next $15k and 20% on the next $15k.

Thank you!\\n\\n_____\\nIt is my contention that the property destruction and disruption of commerce in Ferguson are the only reasons that this issue gained international attention.  We have a democracy that acts almost exclusively in the interests of a small handful of corporate elites and government officials, which causes actual human suffering to be on the back burner.  Other avenues for political redress such as voting and even peaceful protesting by itself (which are ultimately more effective in the end, but typically only after having a flash point or event to rally around) have been largely compromised by corporate interests and strategic incapacitation policing techniques.  There are racially tinged police murders under far less ambiguous circumstances wherein the behavior of the officers is much more difficult to justify that never gained as much traction when protesters hold exclusively peaceful demonstrations, and it underlies our society\\'s perpetual valuing of windows and business over actual human lives.  Moreover, high profile riots make white middle America (which controls the political arena) evaluate the issue.  When White America is afraid that traffic will be blocked, or that their business might be burned/looted, or that a brick might come flying through their living room window, this forces the issue into the public consciousness and varying solutions must be considered.  \\n\\nMany say that the property destruction opened the issue to easy critiques since many are beholden to heavily indoctrinated notions of bourgeois morality (the old two wrongs don\\'t make a right adage, even when one wrong is a death and the other is property being destroyed/stolen), and while this is true it gave people a cause to rally around.  White America and the media are masterful at rationalizing and ignoring systemic racism and police brutality, and while the #blacklivesmatter is obvious propaganda it has kept the discussion of racist policing in the public discourse since it did grow organically after a high profile police shooting.  The rioters took action which has a strong psychological impact on those for whom the issue resonates.  Taking action (even a less than ideal one) has much weight than people claiming to \"support\" a cause without actually giving anything of themselves to it.\\n\\nThe tactic of rallying around a murder to highlight racist inequity has been employed since the Classic Civil Rights Era (see the murder of Emmett Till), and people arguing over whether or not the particular murder in question was less than ideal miss the point entirely.  People are talking about the murder, and (even if for a brief second) the issues that sparked the outrage though this more important narrative is tightly controlled by a media apparatus hellbent on fixating on the explosion than the planting and lighting of the bomb that caused it.  Had it been a perfect situation with the cops saying \"nigger\" before shooting a completely sympathetic victim and even if it was video recorded by a very credible witness, the discussion would have easily devolved into \"this particular cop was just a bad egg,\" and the protests got what they wanted when he was fired/convicted.  \\n\\nBecause of the ambiguity in the Ferguson shooting, the stark contrasts in *perceptions* among blacks and whites becomes a primary issue of contention.  It\\'s not about bad cops getting out of hand on occasion, but about why so many black people have the idea that the cops treat them unfairly or with undue violence.   No one would have even been talking about that had the case been less focused on contradictory narratives, and it would have never even made international news if the police hadn\\'t responded in a militarized fashion to the peaceful protests that were mobilized after the initial riots.  This uproar was never about police militarization or even bad egg cops.  It is about public policies that have created racist law enforcement practices that marginalize and inflame the black community. Not many have said it that articulately, but it\\'s bubbling underneath the surface of the \"national discussion\" on Ferguson.  In an ideal democracy, third party property destruction would perhaps not be a valid form of political voicing, but as blacks are particularly disenfranchised politically and economically in the US, so using militant tactics to express rage at the societal failings I mentioned above are not only inevitably, but necessary.  \\n\\nEDIT:  I\\'ve already responded to a couple of people strawmanning about how the media was mobilized before the rioting after the verdict.  This post is about the first wave of riots that made the issue a sensation in the first place.  \\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

That is to say that the probability of getting a true positive result for a user is 99%, Pr(positive result| true user) = 99%, and the  probability of a true negative given that they are not a user is also 99%. Pr(negative result|true nonuser) =99%\\n\\nNow, this does NOT mean that the probability of being a user given a positive result is 99%. That is not how statistics work. Pr(true user| positive result) ≠ Pr(positive result|true user). In order to get this probability you should use Bayes theorem. This means that you need to know the probability of being a user before you can come up with an answer. \\n\\nSo lets walk through a problem. The test is 99% accurate. We want to determine whether a group of 1000 students are using DrugX. Lets say that 5 of these students actually are using DrugX.

However, this really doesn't seem fair to me at all. Why shouldn't an athlete be allowed to alter themselves through drugs or doping or other methods? Let me explain.\\n\\nMichael Phelps is the most decorated olympian of all time. Why is he so good? Sheer hard work and commitment, right? Sure, he works supremely hard, much harder than any of us regular folk can imagine, but so do all top-tier athletes. Phelps has the advantage of having precisely the perfect body for swimming, which is almost entirely down to nothing else but dumb luck- an arm span of 6 feet 7 inches, double jointed shoulders and ankles, a disproportionately short lower body which reduces resistance, enormous feet, a slow rate of lactic acid production - and so on. Other athletes have the benefit of an unusually fast rate of red blood cell replenishment- something which is of so much advantage in endurance sports, some athletes without this genetic anomaly seek to replicate it artificially through blood doping. Of course, no amount of surgery or drugs or doping could realistically ensure every potential athlete is literally identical- clearly you will never be an NBA star if you are five foot nothing with tiny hands and poor eyesight however hard you try- but surely if a promising athlete *can* reasonably compensate for drawing the genetical short straw (by doing to themselves what ever it is they deem necessary), they should be allowed to do so, as this will tip the field back towards a competition amongst equals and potentially be rewarded for what counts- how hard they work, how much they push themselves, how skilled they have become etc. \\n\\nWhich brings me on to my second point...\\n\\nA lot of those who take against PEDs or blood doping or surgery do so because they think it is some sort of shortcut magic pill that does the work of training for you and cheats the other harder working athletes out of their rightful success, but that's a misconception. Lance Armstrong, probably the most famous recent 'cheat', wasn't some regular guy propelled to success by virtue of the blood doping alone- all doping did was allow him to work harder and longer and respond more effectively to training and thus to outperform his competitors. If we believe competitive sport should reward effort, it seems like nonsense to take against blood doping when all it really does is enable athletes to put in more effort.\\n\\nThirdly, at the level were doping, drugs etc are worth fussing about it seems lots of athletes are artificially interfering and there's a lot of vested interest in that remaining the case. (see for example: /r/sports/comments/1ia00m/tyson_gay_reportedly_caught_doping_pulls_out_of/cb2jh0q). Surely it would be better to bring it above board both so it can be regulated and kept safe, and also publicly known so that fans can assess an athletes worth taking into consideration their natural advantages and disadvantages. \\n\\n\\nTL:DR: If we believe sports should reward effort, not luck, we have no reason to disallow athletes doing anything they can to themselves in order to succeed.

My evidence will admittedly be anecdotal. But honestly so are the complaints I hear about or read especially here on reddit. I\\'d like to present several examples of why I\\'ve been impressed or pleased with Comcast\\'s service. \\n\\n1. **My service is literally never down and I always get the speeds I pay for.** The one time service failed in my neighborhood over the past year, it was due to a massive power outage that affected numerous homes in my neighborhood. Shortly after the power failure, I got a call from a Comcast service tech (he randomly selected me from a list of known customers in my apartment building) to confirm the outage was due to power and not a Comcast issue. I was impressed by this proactive measure as it seemed to fly in the face of many of the complaints I read about here. \\n\\n2. **Prices are fair.** Full disclosure: I only use cable internet, not cable TV. For my first year in my new city, I paid $29.99 for 10 Mbps under a promotion. A month before my promotion was due to expire, I got a call from a customer service rep letting me know my promotion was ending and my monthly rate was about to double. To keep this from happening, she  offered to put me into a new promotion for $15 more, this plan with even more speed, for the next year. This move also impressed me as this really wasn\\'t in Comcast\\'s best interest as they have a monopoly on my entire apartment building (through a contract with the property manager, we have no choice but to subscribe to them, so they could practically charge me whatever). So instead of paying $60 for 10 Mbps, I now pay $45 for 25 Mbps, a move they were under no obligation to do.\\n\\n3. **Customer service is decent.** I had a slight issue with my new contract with I signed up for the new plan. And while I had some frustrations, I expected as much from such a large company dealing with so many calls. Eventually when my call was escalated and I explained my problem, I was actually put into a better plan than I initially signed up for due to my \"frustrations\" (something I didn\\'t ask for). \\n\\nI\\'ve had to deal with Comcast for the past 6-7 years. They had the city I moved from locked down and monopolized. And my current living situation (as noted above) doesn\\'t allow options either. But honestly I\\'m not upset by that. Internet is consistent and reliable. Service techs are on time. Issues are resolved. And the price I pay isn\\'t unreasonable. Their rates for cable are probably horrible, but I haven\\'t paid for TV in years (as is this trend with many people now anyway). So I think it\\'s fair to assess them on their cable internet service alone. Do I look forward to Google Fiber? Hell yeah. But until then, I\\'m not that bad off. \\n\\nSo CMV. \\n\\nAnd before you label me a shill and move on, please review my post history. In the past 2+ years, I\\'ve hardly, if ever, commented on Comcast. I just don\\'t see why the hate is justified. \\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

When watching the theatrical cuts, I get swept into the story.  When watching the extended cuts, I get distracted, and reminded that I'm watching a movie.

I regard the extended cuts as being a novelty for the fans that really want to see the extra material.\\n\\n&gt;I felt that I was sacrificing pacing and momentum in order for these scenes to go in.\\n\\nThe main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better.  Personally, I think it's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it's story telling.  The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor.  They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces (Helms's Deep) and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely (Tom Bombadil).\\n\\nBasically, I'm glad Jackson opted to make excellent **movies,** instead of attempting a shot for shot visualization of a **book,** and I think the extended cuts subvert his success in that regard.\\n\\nBooks and movies are not the same, and in general, **the more an adaptation respects the inherent differences between the various media it's adapting to and from, the better the final product will be.**  This is much more important than it's faithfulness to the source material.  I believe this is true for all adaptations, not just LOTR.  Feel free to C my V on this larger point as well.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It isn't love unless we want our partner to love only ourselves.\\n\\nThis is unrealistic; real people don't meet this standard, and should not. Jealousy is a sick and twisted emotion, based in possessiveness, insecurity, and fear. It's perverse that we take this for granted, even uphold it as a moral high ground.

Addiction is most commonly associated with gambling, drugs, alcohol and nicotine, but **it\\'s possible to be addicted to anything**](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/addiction/Pages/addictionwhatisit.aspx)\\n\\n\\nEmphasis mine. \\n\\nNow, this is a definition from a medical body, and so presumably the definition used when \"treating\" \"addicts\".\\n\\nIt claims addicts do \"not have control\", clearly this cannot be the case because if it were addicts would never cease to be addicts and could never give up their substance, yet we know people give up their substances all the time and they give them up by a conscious choice to cease taking that substance. \\n\\nThe definition also claims that it is possible to be addicted to anything, well, it seems to me that if anything is potentially addictive then nothing is addictive. \\n\\nThe definition goes on to say:\\n\\n&gt;This [strong urge] can develop into a habit that becomes very hard to stop.\\n\\nNotice here it says \"Very hard\" not \"impossible\" but if someone has \"no control\" as was perviously said, surely it would be impossible to stop, not just very hard?\\n\\n&gt;Being addicted to something means that not having it causes withdrawal symptoms or a ‘come down’. Because this can be unpleasant, it\\'s easier to carry on having or doing what you crave, and so the cycle continues. \\n\\nIndeed, it it certainly easier to do something that is enjoyable over something that is unpleasant, but that is still a choice one makes, no?\\n\\nNow, on the point of addiction being a disease. Well, the \"cure\" for nicotine addiction is to chose to stop smoking cigarettes, to abstain from them. They chose to take them up, and they chose to stop taking them. Someone suffering from cancer has not chosen to have it and cannot chose not to have it.

I have, over the last little while, gone from feeling that essentially unregulated and uncensored activity on the internet is a good thing, to believing the opposite. Here are my reasons, though not in a particularly lucid or well-structured form. Also, I understand that the gap between principle and practicality is vast, so I offer my points only as ethical ones.\\n\\nLibel: Essentially the internet is a publishing platform. If a newspaper or other media outlet has to obey the laws of libel and defamation, should an individual who is publishing things publicly not have to do the same? As an example, earlier I read a comment in a thread about Ted Nugent. The comment made a fairly strong statement regarding his sexual preferences. If this was on TV or in a newspaper, the outlet would be in seriously dodgy territory. In this case, an anonymous person can say anything and gets to live by different rules, despite the intention being to publish their view for worldwide public consumption. I think this is wrong.\\n\\nData protection: Despite the above, I think companies should be extremely limited regarding what data they are allowed to store about people. The fact that millions of lines of code in various places churn through my online activity and that Google, Amazon, etc. have a virtual model of me should not be allowed. For example, Amazon should not be allowed to record the history of what I browse. I see this as akin to having a shop assistant follow you round a store with a camcorder as you browse and believe that companies who do this should be heavily prosecuted.\\n\\nPiracy: I understand that the issue of piracy is a complex one, but I feel that a growing attitude treats all information in digital form as almost a right. I think this is wrong, and that all copyright laws should be equal regardless of whether someone sells fake DVDs from their car boot, or runs a torrenting site. I believe that Google should not list any sits that link to illegal copyright infringement, and that they are complicit in the violations of law.\\n\\nNow, I understand that there are a great deal of complicated parts of this, especially when it comes to things like expressing dissident political views, government surveillance, etc. and I know how ill-formed my point is. I suppose that by offering these views for criticism and rebuttal I want help clarifying what I truly think.\\n\\nTLDR: Unregulated, anonymous activity that is largely without personal consequence is not a good thing. People should be as liable for what they do online as if they did it on TV or in the middle of the street. \\n\\nEdit 1: let me be explicit in saying that I am not claiming innocence of any of these things, but that recently I have been asking myself ethical questions and an uncomfortable with answers I find myself giving, and my beliefs are changing because of it.\\n\\nEdit 2: I have to go out for the rest of the night, but I will reply tomorrow and give more thought to all points made.

I\\'m not overweight(130 lbs 5\"9 male), nor do I have any serious imperfections. I\\'m by no means attractive(I wear glasses and I don\\'t lift much), but I\\'m not horribly ugly either.  Only saying this because I don\\'t want to sound like some SJW that\\'s upset that they\\'re ugly and oppressed or some shit. Probably shouldn\\'t have to say this though since the /r/changemyview community is *usually* pretty mature with their responses.\\n\\nWikipedia states that \"Users who receive high ratings may be notified by email that they are in the \\'top half of OkCupid\\'s most attractive users\\' and \\'will now see more attractive people in [their] match results\\'. The email also reads \\'And, no, we didn\\'t just send this email to everyone on OkCupid. Go ask an ugly friend and see\\'.\\n\\nFirst off, I personally believe attractiveness is subjective-different people prefer different things. Some might think curly hair is ugly, some may think its pretty. Some may think tatoos are sexy, some may think they look stupid. Some may prefer blonde hair, some may prefer black hair. These things, while people may share different opinions, should still not make too big of a difference due to things averaging out.\\n\\nHowever, other things may not average out so well. For example, females with a flat chest/smaller body(for lack of a better term) are considered unattractive by most men. However, there are some men who find this physical feature quite attractive. But because this is likely a minority opinion, women with this physical characteristic may receive low ratings, and as a result, not show up in results to attractive men with this particular preference. There are plenty of factors in which a minority of people may find attractive, whereas most would find unattractive. Point being, I feel like beauty is, to a degree, subjective, and simply matching the people that are voted most attractive isn\\'t the best way to ensure lasting relationships.\\n\\nSecondly, setting the threshold to 50% means that it will result in poor self esteem for for those that don\\'t receive it. If you don\\'t receive the message, it implies you\\'re in the bottom 50%, thus \\'below average\\', and therefore ugly. The message also seems to take a rather ill-mannered tone. The lack of receiving this message can result in greater depression. I\\'m not saying that people shouldn\\'t own up to accept the bad things about them, and deal with their problems, but I don\\'t think OKCupid needs to run their system in a way that reminds everyone of it. Changing the threshhold to something like 80% or 90% would result in positive reinforcement for those who receive it, without it being too negative if you don\\'t receive it.\\n\\nLastly, it creates a narrow way of searching for a \"compatible\" SO.

A leader who is closer to the people has more powerful, because he or she can demonstrate their popular support. For example, when the Indian PM, Narendra Modi, visited the United States, he was mobbed like a rock star in New York City by 20,000 people. It's hard to imagine a Chinese leader receiving such a reception.\\n\\nSecondly, in a liberal democratic system a free press and freedom of arts and culture do not threaten the government. Currently, China does not produce very good arts and culture. American shows, such as the Big Bang Theory are more popular in China than home grown ones. Korea has been far more successful at exporting its culture than China, despite being less than 1/10th the size. Why is China, such a big country, so poor as producing culture? Because creative artists are stifled by the PRC censorship machine. Besides arts, to remain in power the government also has to censor alternative belief systems, such as Christianity and Falun Gong. However, people should have the right to express their own belief systems. If belief systems are suppressed, this leads people to turn to materialism, hedonism, and xenophobia, which corrupt and degrade the culture.\\n\\nThirdly, the authoritarian government is pursuing a one-child policy that is very outdated, since the average Chinese woman already has only 1.5 children. Evidence from other East Asian countries suggests that the problem is an aging society and too few people, not too many. Demographically, this will weaken China's economy in the long term. Also, this is a cruel and inhumane policy because if you only have one child, and they are killed for whatever reason, then you will go into old age alone and with no hope. Only children also tend to be spoiled. In a liberal democratic society, people would be able to vote on whether they want to keep this policy, but in most free societies, it is a right to have more than one child for all citizens.\\n\\nFourthly, a liberal democratic China would have better relations with the outside world. The U.S. is the world's premiere superpower, both militarily, economically, culturally, and technologically. While some reports say that China has overtaken the U.S. economically, if it happened it was only be because China is much more populous than the U.S. The average Chinese still lives the life of a citizen of a developing country. The U.S. is still far ahead of China on science, innovation, having dynamic companies, etc. Therefore, it is important for China to have good relations with the U.S. This will be much more facilitated if the two countries share liberal, democratic values. China's relations with Japan and Taiwan will be much better for the same reason. Both of these countries are liberal democracies, and China very much wants good relations with Taiwan to effect some sort of future union. This will be made much easier if China is a democracy. Finally, studies show that it is very rare for two democracies to go to war with one another, so the chance of China being dragged into a war would be diminished.\\n\\nFifth, liberal democracy is the morally right form of government to have. Governments ask for a monopoly on power, so they must justify this monopoly on the basis of acting in the interests of the people. Who else to know the interests of the people than the people themselves? If the people of China really think the CCP is doing a good job, they can always vote in a CCP government in a democratic manner. The desire for having basic human rights, such as due process of law, freedom of association, freedom of speech, and input into one's government is not a Western value- it is a universal value. Hence why you see no clamor for authoritarianism in Taiwan or Hong Kong.\\n\\nI believe that if the CCP initiated a peaceful transition to democracy, it could be carried out in a much more successful manner than the Soviet Union did in 1991. For one thing, the Soviet Union was divided into autonomous republics that took up huge chunks of the state. China, on the other hand, is a largely unitary state with a mono-ethnic population that has lasted for over 2,000 as a single civilization. Also, the Soviet Union had to change its whole economy from socialism to capitalism. China, on the other hand, is already a mixed economy and would not require such a drastic change. On the other hand, the leaders of the CCP would be seen historically as visionaries who finally completed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's vision of tutelage of China into a modern liberal democracy.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

(In the U.S.)',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2qgkou',\n  'selftext': 'There are two major methods of identifying highway exits in the United States. One is to identify them by mile marker, the other is to use a simple ordinal system.\\n\\nThe state of New York identifies highway exits by simply choosing one end of the highway and starting to count exits up one at a time. For example, exit 1 on I-90 is located in Yonkers, while exit 61 is the last before the Pennsylvania border. [A list of the exits.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway#Mainline_2)\\n\\nThis has a number of significant problems. First, the addition of new exits results in the addition of extremely confusing \"A\" and \"B\" exits. It\\'s much easier than renumbering all the exits on the highway, but it\\'s also extremely confusing. Second, portions of the highway not on the main line need a separate system. The NYS Thruway uses B1-B3 for the connector to the Massachusetts Turnpike. And third, there is no way of knowing how far it is to the next exit. I know I got on at exit 12 and need to get off at exit 20, but I have no idea if the distance is 20 miles or 120 miles.\\n\\nThe second option is far superior. States like Ohio and Pennsylvania identify highway exits by the mile marker. If you get on the highway at exit 20 and plan to get off at exit 120, you know that you will be driving 100 miles. This is very sensible. Also, adding a new exit is simple! If there is no other exit in that highway mile, adding a new number is trivial. In the case of multiple exits in the same mile, A and B is easy to understand and also alerts drivers to the fact that multiple exits will be happening in a short space of road.\\n\\nFinally, states like New York are *already* numbering the miles on their highways to use in support of law enforcement and emergency crews to identify the location of accidents. It would be relatively easy to change the system and there would be only benefits to adopting the mile marker system.\\n\\nCMV.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think they are the shittiest creatures on this planet and if I had a time machine I would almost certainly do my best to make sure they were never adopted as pets.\\n\\nNow for a long time I was impartial to the ownership of cats, it did not really bother me, but a month or so back some of our neighbours got one.  Since that happened it has been giving us hell.  The damn thing keeps stealing food from our house, scratching furniture and coming home at night to find a cat on your bed if you happen to be allergic to them is the worst thing ever.  So, why don\\'t I just keep my house closed you might ask?  Well I live in South Africa and due to the expense of air-conditioning we primarily cool our house by leaving windows and doors open.  Additionally I do not see why we should be forced to change our lifestyle so the neighbours can own a cat.  \\n\\nBasically I feel cat ownership should be illegal mainly as it negatively impacts the lives of other people in your community forcing them to adapt to your cat.  Additionally cats do a great deal of damage to the local environment by killing many small birds and reptiles.  For example we had chameleons in our yard for quite some time and they were awesome, but then our neighbour\\'s cat killed them all.\\n\\nNow I know there are probably people who somehow manage to keep their cats confined to their house or yard somehow and I have no issue with these people.   Let them be able to apply for a cat ownership license and be subject to a fine if their cat happens to wander into your yard.\\n\\nEdit - Additionally I found that the region where I live has legislature that it is illegal if dogs are not \"properly and adequately fenced to keep such a dog inside when it is not on a leash, unless the dog is confined to the premises in some other manner\".  In essence I feel this law should apply to cats as well.\\n\\n\\n2nd edit - View has been changed by stevegcook.  The fact that cats can be kept indoors means that legislation holding cat-owners responsible for their cats is feasible.

I\\'m fine with doubling that cost since my plan probably includes more people.\\n\\nBut anyways, there\\'s three main reasons I think we should do this:\\n\\n1. Moral/philosophical reasons: The US first put blacks through years of slavery. Then, in the Jim Crow south, their property was deliberately taken from them, often in ways that law enforcement would ignore or even support. But even after the Civil Rights act, the problems were still there. Many blacks were forced into lower-income neighborhoods. Many of them still received lower-quality education, not only because of segregation, but also because people didn\\'t want to allocate resources to \"black areas.\" In addition to the fact that they don\\'t have access to the networking that many whites did, I believe all of these made it so that blacks systematically were deprived of any shot at equality. The issue with this is that they all consented to the governance of the US just as much as the whites did, and deserved equal protection according to the constitution. When a government fails to fulfill the social contract, it has an obligation to attempt to correct for it, or else it is not a legitimate government that can be held to any sort of social contract or constitution.\\n\\n2. Economic/social reasons: I think this would at least be a meaningful step to economic equality for blacks. I think this is really important is because a lot of the reason racism is still alive today is because blacks tend to be around blacks and whites tend to be around whites, so there\\'s no exposure to the other races. This makes it much easier to stereotype blacks as lazy, or thuggish, or less intelligent, whether the stereotypes are conscious or subconscious. If you give blacks more money, they have more access to education resources, which allows them to get to private schools, or better colleges, or better professions. The more blacks have access to these opportunities, the less that people are going to be able to stereotype them as thugs, or in less severe cases, subconsciously assume that blacks are of a poorer or less educated background. I think the latter is the source of most racism today, and that by getting more blacks in higher positions would solve it through exposure theory.\\n\\n3. Political reasons: I think it would be an important symbolic statement from the government. Many poor black communities are ravaged by crime because they have a sense of abandonment from the government, and feel less of an obligation to respect it. I think the actual money would solve for a lot of this, but the statement alone is a recognition of past harms and shows solidarity and understanding with them. I think this would lead to less disillusionment in these communities\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

More than college, more than the latest novel, more than socializing, etc. I for one would drop everything to focus exclusively on it and any other action, given confidence in that knowledge, seems insane to me.\\n\\nIn this sense I feel like older religious traditions (Jewish Torah scholarship, Muslim memorization of the Quran, Christian monks secluding themselves for religious contemplation and study, etc.) which placed extreme emphasis on their holy books were acting far more rationally.\\n\\nTo give an analogy for how I feel, it would be like if I was sitting on reddit and a giant glowing hand burst through my bedroom wall and began to write a letter on my wall for me starting with \"Dear Bezant,\" and I just thought \"Ehhhh, I wonder if there\\'s any funny new memes today?\" then a few days later asked my roommate if anything in the letter seared onto my wall seemed important.\\n\\n**Edit:** Thanks for the debate all! I\\'m heading to bed, but some further thoughts that occured to me while talking with everyone.\\n\\nHave sacred texts somehow entered the mundane realm by being such a fixture of everyday life, that the human mind for some reason almost always refuses to consider it remarkable, even if it genuinely believes it is the most unique thing on earth?\\n\\nI\\'ll do my best to answer any new counterarguments tomorrow.\\n\\n**Edit 2:** Wow this is still at the top! \\n\\nI\\'ll post /u/greygoop8\\'s version here, I think he captured it in a way that doesn\\'t evoke all the specific religious arguments:\\n\\n&gt;I don\\'t know if you are really appreciating what it would mean to believe a text is sacred.\\n\\n&gt;Think of this scenario. You get contacted by an alien who takes you on a tour around the universe showing off technologies that look like magic to you and that break what you thought were the rules of the universe. They can manipulate time, space, energy and matter in ways you never imagined, nevermind thought possible. They tell you they\\'ve been around since before the big bang and have figured out how to survive the multiple heat deaths of the universe that they\\'ve already lived through. The knowledge they have about the universe makes your current knowledge look like that of an insect compared to a human.\\n\\n&gt;Then they give you a book, in your native language, that\\'s about 1,000 pages, written in a way to try to help you better understand the universe and explain to you the greatest mysteries of life.\\n\\n&gt;How could you not devote all your energy to reading and studying that text until you know it inside and out?\\n\\n&gt;If I believed the bible was the direct word of an omnipotent being trying to give me a message, I wouldn\\'t put it down. I don\\'t know how anyone who actually believed a text was divine could do otherwise.\\n\\nSo, if you want to CMV, I would suggest arguing one of two points:\\n\\na) to the human mind, a religious text isn\\'t \\'divine\\' in the same way the alien\\'s gift would be. \\n\\nb) a relatively disinterested reaction to such a gift is reasonable\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It pays it's 5 laborers with $1000/month. The profits is $10000 dollars per month, so $5000 goes to the laborers salaries and $5000 in the owner's pocket.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn come the immigrants from poor countries, which find a $500 dollar salary very attractive. They can do with this because they are used to living in shitty conditions and being frugal. The company hires them, and the owner now has $7500 in his pocket monthly. \\n\\n\\n\\nNow the immigrants are lowering the wages, because recently nobody would work for less than $1000, now they have 2 options: be unemployed or hop on the bandwagon. There are too many people and not enough jobs.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course, with more profits, the company can afford to make a new production line and create more jobs. But these jobs are also payed with $500/month instead of $1000/month. So more money for the owner.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sole beneficiary of this is the factory owner, who gets cheap labor at the same quality. Also, the immigrants are sending part of their money home, thus taking money out of the economy.\\n\\n\\n\\nShouldn't the government protect it's own citizens? Because not everybody has a business and relies on cheap labor to have bigger profits, you will always find unskilled labor in developed countries. The only reason they are paid less is that there is lots of it. I think the majority of people would prefer an office job than doing manual labor, yet office jobs are paid more, because there isn't such a big supply of skilled people. In a country full of people who want office jobs, the plumbers would be paid like kings.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo why isn't the government protecting it's own citizens from the risk of having to work for less because of immigrants? Could it be that the contributors to their political campaign is, you guessed it, the factory owners, who have a lot to gain from this immigration policy?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore you tell me that Einstein was an immigrant, I'm referring here to hiring people in workplaces where you do not need extremely special skills (from bus drivers to nurses and assembly line workers). For example in some countries, you have to prove you can not find a native to do an immigrant's job before you hire the immigrant. \\n\\n\\n\\nBefore you accuse me of being a UKIP fan, I am just saying this because I think I have the ability to view things from a objective point of view.

The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents.  Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men didn't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later.\\n\\nAre we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks?  Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me, and it seriously strains credulity to begin with.  Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God.  Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace, but there's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks.  Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving.\\n  \\nThe obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels.  Joseph probably would have made that barn the family's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men hadn't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt. After all, why did they stay so long anyway?  It's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate.  Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes.

Yet people end up being labeled a \"cheapskate\" and/or an \"asshole\" when what it really amounts to is a misunderstanding.

From what I can tell, there is very little skill involved in playing the game, it just seems to be a giant crapshoot the whole way through.\\n\\n\"Monopoly\" was made with the intent to explain why localised monopolies are bad for the economy and to explain the Single Tax theory of Henry George.^1 Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. Once ~50% of the board has been claimed, even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal, it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in another\\'s territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. After that, it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others, decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them.\\n\\nWhile this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players. One after another, a player pays out the net-worth to the other players until there is a long, long drawn-out stand-off between the remaining few. At this point, it comes to down to complete and utter chance. Whomever gets the worst successive dice rolls loses. When that happens, barring any statistically unlikely dice rolls, it is evident who will lose. But the game keeps going and going, because it would be \"unfair\" to keep going despite the likely outcome.\\n\\nIf Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance (perhaps a redesign of the board, more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better \"Chance\" cards, or even removal of the pieces entirely) and to be quicker (Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily, for example) then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone. As of right now, after the first few passes around the board, it is easier to calculate the theoretical outcome with the help of a computer then to finish the game to its completion.\\n\\nPlease change my view, for the sake of family game night. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n&gt;^1 Orbanes, Philip E.

I was paid $9 for my day of service, plus $0.10/mile traveled.  All told, I was offered about $11 for a full day (8am to 430pm) of labor.  No food was provided, or other compensation available.  This is a significant undervaluing of labor (and mileage), which would be paid at least the prevailing minimum wage (and a higher mileage rate) in just about any other case.  Courts are getting their labor supply of jurors extremely cheaply, and so they undervalue the service (in simple economic terms)\\n\\nI found the process highly inefficient from the perspective of a juror.  Lots of waiting around, poor management, poor scheduling, and overall a highly inefficient system.  But, this should not be surprising, since jurors are so cheap.  There is no motivation for the courts to improve the process, because the cost of jurors is minimal.   I believe that if the courts had to pay jurors a prevailing wage and expenses, it would motivate them to streamline the process, and make it more efficient, since they would have a significant cost pressure to do so.\\n\\nIn my opinion, jury selection is a highly inefficient process in our current legal system, which could be made significantly more efficient without compromising the legal process in any way.  However, without an incentive, these types of improvements will never happen.\\n\\nFurthermore, by paying someone well below state and federal wage guidelines, we encourage the notion that jury duty holds little value and is a chore to be avoided, rather than a valued service to our democracy.\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I’ll use some text from that last post to refine here.\\n\\nThe [Grandfather Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox) states that you can’t go back and kill your grandfather, because logically you would never be born to kill your grandfather in the first place. However, I believe that simply going back in time at all creates a paradox on the atomic level. Logical grandfather paradoxes were made up for drama and to relate people to the story. The universe doesn't care if you kill your grandfather, or try to do things precisely the same (you can't), it's already different the moment you take a breath. This leads to reason that if your trip backwards in time is successful, you can safely assume that a universe-ending paradox will not occur, at least not instantaneously. Some implementations in movies (Primer, Butterfly Effect) show that paradoxes create only local or restricted disruptions in space-time, or that the changes “ripple-through” to the rest of the universe; this could also be valid in this thought experiment. However, considering the following conditions:\\n\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A trip backwards in time has occurred and was successful\\n\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The traveler is safe and the universe is intact\\n\\nThen it stands to reason that simply by existing in the previous timeline, a grand-scale paradox couldn’t occur. We shouldn’t consider that killing your grandfather might cause the destruction of the universe and can basically do what we want in any timeline because most likely (with the available information), it would either create or enter a different timeline, or be self-consistent in the first place.\\n\\nCMV\"},\n {'title': 'CMV:Suicide can be a rational decision, even for the depressed and otherwise mentally ill.',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2q6d06',\n  'selftext': \"\\nLet's say you're 18, and diagnosed with chronic depression. You'll have to be on medication and in and out of therapy for the rest of your life just to be able to function. Your choices are basically a life in a perpetually zonked out state, or a life of crippling pain and misery. \\n\\n\\nIn my opinion, it'd be perfectly  reasonable for this person to consider his options, take an objective look at them, and conclude that the best course of action is suicide. It'd be perfectly valid and rational to decide that ceasing to live is superior to a lifetime of chronic mental illness, and all the costs (financial, social, familial/interpersonal, etc) associated with managing it and living with it. \\n\\n\\nI specifically use depression/mental illness as an example because people often argue that depressed, or mentally ill people shouldn't have the option of euthanasia because their illness clouds their ability to realistically assess their situation. In my example, the depressed person's reasoning appears perfectly sound so I don't see why he shouldn't commit suicide. \\n\\n\\nCan you CMV? \\n\\n\\n**EDIT:** a lot of people have made the point that a depressed or otherwise mentally ill person is irrational by nature and unable to make rational decisions about something as serious as suicide. Ok, that's a fair point. So, what if the person is medicated and in a sound state of mind when they come to the conclusion that suicide is the best option? \\n\\n\\nAnother common argument is that chronic mental illness is often (mostly?) manageable, sometimes very effectively with relative ease. Fair point. How about cases where the illness is not easily manageable? Where it requires a cocktail of drugs, constant therapy and relapses are common and can occur at any time?\\n\\n\\nOr, say the person suffers from schizophrenia, which is incurable and requires lifetime treatment. The medication often comes with many unpleasant side effects, and sometimes leaves the sufferer in a zombie-like state. Think the protagonist in *A Beautiful Mind*. \\nOther than a severely diminished quality of life, the person may also feel a burden to his/her family, likely be socially isolated, have a hard time holding down a job, etc. Couldn't he/she rationally decide such a life is simply not worth living? \\n\\n\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you don't know what I'm referring to, when New York Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the hospital where the two officers died, several other officers who were present turned their backs on him in a deliberate show of disrespect. De Blasio is currently facing major criticism from the NYPD unions and even had to have a press conference today where the police commissioner defended him to try and calm things down.\\n\\nThe officers who publicly and intentionally disrespected the Mayor ought to lose their jobs. If I publicly disrespected my boss, you'd better believe I would get the axe.\\n\\nPolice officers are charged with a public duty to keep the peace and obey the policies set forth by their superiors. If they don't like it they're free to complain in private just like anyone, but to use their public profiles to make a point is unacceptable. Worse, New York is clearly in need of unity right now and creating further division is a serious safety hazard. These officers aren't just failing in their jobs, they're actively causing damage.\\n\\nIt's just ridiculous that they thought this was okay to do. They definitely knew what they were doing, so it would be silly to claim they didn't realize it would make the news. They're blaming de Blasio for senseless murders committed by a man who was obviously insane - on the same day, he shot his girlfriend and then committed suicide. The fact that (like most of America) he criticized the NYPD on Twitter is irrelevant, and even if it did matter that has nothing to do with the Mayor.\\n\\nRegardless of whether its fair or not, the NYPD currently needs to fix its public image in the interest of public safety. Police officers are supposed to be respectable figures who put the public's needs above their own. These officers clearly violated that mission and are trying to stir up trouble, so they should lose their jobs immediately.\\n\\nCMV\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Although I\\'m in no rush, I have been getting more serious about it recently, and really thinking about whats important to me. I have concluded that looks are the most important thing to me in a mate, not because I am superficial or shallow, but because I believe that looks are the best indicator of ones overall health, intellect, and the types of choices they make. Let me elaborate...\\n\\nFirst off, let me clarify that \"looks\" is both subjective and objective/universal. There are certain things like reasonable symmetry, youth (prime fertility), and good health that most people find attractive. Other things are completely subjective like race, hair color, body type, etc.... \\n\\nI think \"beauty\" is the default trigger of male attraction to females by nature, and for good reason. Beauty signals health, fertility, good genes, intellect, good decision making, and the subjective part of looks probably has something to do with traits that blend well with my own genes.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, I want my children to be healthy, intelligent, athletic, loving etc... I believe that what a person looks like on the outside is a pretty accurate indication of what they are like on the inside. There are always exceptions to the rule, like injured/diseased people etc, but I feel that this is generally true.\\n\\nContinuing on with why looks are important to me:\\n\\nYouth: Prime fertility for women is between 20 and 35. I have always found women in their mid twenties to early thirties to be the most attractive. This coincides with high fertility zones with women, increasing the chances of conception and lowering the risk of birth defects.\\n\\nSymmetry: I\\'m not huge on this but facial symmetry is a decent indicator of good genes as shown in scientific studies.\\n\\nBody type: I am attracted to fit, curvy women. This is more of a subjective thing when it comes to looks however there is science behind it. I\\'m not attracted to rail thin women or overly ripped women, and its been shown that women with body fat too low don\\'t menstruate and are less fertile. I\\'m also not attracted to overweight women, which is a signal of poor impulse control, possible hormonal abnormalities, lower intellect, or other things which I would not want my children to inherit. I am attracted to curves, and both large breasts and bubble butt appear to be sexual fertility signals on an otherwise fit and healthy woman. Boobs indicate a woman can feed newborns and the shape/size/etc of the butt possibly indicates fitness levels that may be related to sex and procreation.\\n\\nIntellect: I feel that you can read people through their eyes and body language even more so than you can with words. These are both subsets of \"looks\". It has been said that most communication is nonverbal. You can often tell how people are wired from how they look. Perhaps they are book smart but socially inept, or incapable of abstract thought but extremely socially savvy, etc. Looks hint at how peoples brains functions. \\n\\nDisposition: I feel that a persons disposition, whether they are loving or vicious, compassionate or heartless can be read through their looks. This is something that is more complicated however and may not be apparent at first glance. It may take a long time and multiple encounters with someone to be able to read how their looks convey their disposition.\\n\\nSo to finish, looks are the most important thing to me. And by looks I don\\'t mean the objectified woman who most men agree is the hottest thing ever. By looks I mean my own subjective attraction to how a particular woman appears and the message her appearance conveys to me. Perhaps most men are like this, because when most men tell their wife she\\'s beautiful they are being honest, subjectively. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We are generally considered a social animal, but are even able to survive on our own by hunting, gathering, growing/farming (recent), planning, etc...

But as technology progresses it takes less jobs to accomplish similar productivity. If this trend is to continue, there will be less and less jobs required but more and more productivity. Eventually, most things should become far more efficient if not outright automated. This means jobs will become a thing of the past. We are already seeing this happen in todays world with corporate profits higher than ever, yet people unable to find jobs to support themselves. The situation will only get worse as technology and productivity improves.\\n\\nNow you could argue that as jobs are replaced, new jobs are created. But if something is more efficient, that means you are getting more productivity from less work. That means you are replacing 10 manufacturing jobs with 1 engineering job, 1 scientist job, 1 controller job, 1 sales job, and perhaps 5 robotics and computer software programs. This will continue and 10 scientists will be replaced by 1 scientist and 10 engineer by 1 engineer.\\n\\nSo inherently, the concept of job is flawed.

They find recruits to get more recruits, and more and so forth, sending their money to the top by either purchasing \"training\" programs or \"products\". Most of their profits come from \"internal purchases\" of their product from these representatives and turn a huge profit for those on top. The [promotional videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHCMhmG6jLI) are not aimed for selling a product, but for recruitment efforts through showing flashy cars and young slick salespeople living the lifestyle that seems attainable. But instead, people receive mountains of debt or little profit in return. \\n\\nTheir excuses are BS too:\\n\\n- \"Pyramid schemes are illegal. We are still in business for over x amount of years. Plus we sell a product. So we are not a pyramid scheme\". The corporate loophole they use is that they are a business that sells a product. But the concept of a pyramid scheme is still there. Recruits purchase most of their products, not consumers. \\n\\n- \"All businesses operate in a pyramid form. CEO on top, Directors on the next level, Managers next, etc.\". This pisses me off the most. They manipulate organizational structures of legitimate businesses to establish their own scheme. MLMs organizational structures heavily rely on two or three types of positions and their \"recruits\" within their own structure directly provide the profits for the company\\'s survival. Most business organizations do not include the consumer or customer as a position in their structure because profit is irrelevant this illustration. \\n\\n- \"You are just small minded. Go work at your 9-5 while I will make my millions in a month\". Disgusting how this justifies a scheme like theirs. \\n\\nThus, because MLMs and network market corps work in these ways, they should immediately be shut down and made illegal. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Yes it is true that many products are marketed by showing the viewer shots of a general lifestyle that does not really pertain to the product, but the difference is that medicine is far more complicated and can do far more harm to a person if purchased hastily than something like gum or a coffee machine.

Why not just send doctors a brochure of the latest in medication? \\n\\nThere is also an arguement to be had for the \"vote with your dollar\" concept of capitalism, but in my view medicine is exempt from this because no one wants to have to buy medicine and no one who is not a doctor is qualified to say which medication is \"better\", as well as the fact that most consumers are not going to try a variety and medicines and keep buying that which they like the best as is the case with shampoo or food. To me, commercials for medicines are a shameless way for pharma companies to plug something and make money. Pharma should not be about profit, but results.

But marriage isn't that, it is simple commitment to another person. The main issue that gay marriage has is that not all couples are given the same civil liberties, but this does not mean that their marriages are void.

So here goes: Having bought a game on one platform, it\\'s not immoral to pirate the same game on another platform. I\\'m not even really talking legally (though feel free to inform me), but wether I am negatively influencencing the \"victim\" company(s) with this.\\n\\nThis of course excludes remakes, GOTY editions and other versions that add (substantially) to the game, assuming you own the vanilla version. This does not include \"better graphics on PC\" or \"Keyboard/mouse support\".By buying the game on one platform I have compensated the developer fully for all the work gone into making it, buying another version that adds nothing to the previously bought version is just paying twice the price for one product, solely because the rivalery of companies (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) prevents cross-buy.   \\n\\nExpanding on my personal buying behaviour, 90% percent of the time I wouldn\\'t have re-bought the game anyway, and am doing it purely for convenience (bought on Xbox, torrenting on laptop so I can play it when I\\'m gone too) so the developer/console-company won\\'t make a loss on my illigal copy, and the other 10% of the time I might be interested in rebuying a game bought on console for PC for, say, the mods (which are fully made by people outside the company, and do so for no profit), and I still might just have enjoyed the game enough to justify a rebuy if the price is right (i.e. I enjoyed the first Fable game greatly on Xbox, and  bought Fable: TLC in a Steam sale for $3 so I could play it again with mouse + keyboard and in widescreen. This port technically has some added content but is also the only version available on PC, I wasn\\'t interested in the extra content and could have done without would I have had the option. Therefore, I wouldn\\'t have felt guilty about torrenting it but at that price I have no issue considering the fun and time I put into it already.) \\n\\nYou could argue that in theory, I could buy a console that a company has been selling at a loss in hopes of earning this back in sold games, and pirate every single game on it as I already own them on another gaming machine, therfore have the console company make a loss on me. I think that\\'s  a risk you take when you\\'re selling your machine at a loss, and if that business model doesn\\'t work for you, change it. Of course the odds of someone doing specifically this are very, very low, and is but a minor dent in the ten/hundred thousands or even millions of consumers raking in the profits for these companies. I would be no more harm to them than a person buying the sole console only to let it eat dust in the basement, not to mention the fact that I have a perfectly fine gaming laptop and wouldn\\'t be buying their consoles anyway if it wasn\\'t for their exclusives, which as the name suggests, are exclusive to that console. Along with that, pirating a game on pc fully cuts out the \"machine-developer\" middle man and makes the \"loss\" go directly to the game developer.\\n\\nI think that\\'s pretty much it, I thought this up on the spot and read it over a few times but there might be some holes in it, feel free to use those of course.

I say this not because you should care what my personal feelings are, but to establish that I am not a guy who couldn\\'t believe that our government could do something like this. I still believe that they *could*. I just don\\'t believe that they *did*. \\n\\nThe problem I have with the pro-conspiracy crowd is that they will do or say anything to support their narrative, but they will not give the time of day to other explanations. They have refused to change their stance when evidence and logic has overwhelmingly proved them wrong. In fact, they refuse to even acknowledge arguments or evidence that don\\'t support their claims. \\n\\nI\\'ll go through some of the major points here.\\n\\n**Building 7**\\n\\nThis was a major lynchpin in the early days of the conspiracy movement. Many people would simply hold up signs or post on messageboards \"Google WTC7\". I believe the idea was that they thought WTC7 wasn\\'t reported on in the early days of/after 9/11, but I always found this weird because I clearly remember that it was. It just wasn\\'t a focus because it was smaller and had been evacuated. The conspiracy crowd says this building wasn\\'t hit by a plane and that it fell at freefall speed for no reason. I find this frustratingly specious, because while it wasn\\'t hit by a plane, we have known for years exactly why it fell, and that it did not fall at freefall speeds. WTC 7 was hit by a very large section of the collapsing WTC1, which was on fire. This started a fire in 7 that burned unfought all day long. Every professional on the ground knew it was going to collapse (which is why the BBC reported it early). This makes it doubly dangerous to believe WTC7 conspiracies because you would have to believe the FDNY was in on it. They looked at it on an up close and personal level and knew it was coming down. To say it was demolished would be to say that the firefighters who were there are lying. This is not only incredibly offensive but it makes the conspiracy too big (who let them in on it and why? Why haven\\'t any of them spilled the beans? What could they have been paid that was worth more than 343 of their brothers\\' lives?)\\n\\n**\"The buildings fell at freefall speeds\"**\\n\\nThis has been debunked for many years. There are videos where you can count from collapse initiation to the ground and see for yourself that the buildings fell at speeds consistent with such a collapse-- which is shockingly fast, but not freefall speed. To still be saying this after it has been so thoroughly proven wrong is not a mistake, it\\'s a lie. \\n\\n**\"There was molten steel at ground zero\"**\\n\\nNot only is there zero evidence of molten steel at ground zero (besides pics that were proven to be photoshopped), a demolition wouldn\\'t cause molten steel either. All that\\'s here are eyewitness reports, which are notoriously unreliable. The most likely explanation is that people saw warped and deformed steel and used the casual term \"molten\" to describe it. \\n\\n**\"Larry Silverstein profited from the attacks\"\"** \\n\\nNo he didn\\'t. And this is inconsistent with any conspiracy narrative. [**Edit:** see comments for further discussion of this point. Removed a superfluous reference here.]\\n\\n\\nI could go point-by-point on many other aspects of this event, but my larger point here is that *the pro conspiracy crowd knows all of these arguments too, and refuses to acknowledge them.* That\\'s not how facts or truth or logic or reasoning or science works. That\\'s not how an investigation works. That\\'s not how you get to the truth of a matter. \\n\\nPerhaps the biggest problem with the 9/11 conspiracy theory is that it isn\\'t a theory at all. A theory is a narrative. A theory explains. A theory adjusts for new information and corrects for mistaken, incomplete, or outdated information. The 9/11 conspiracy theory is none of this. It doesn\\'t explain anything. It isn\\'t internally or externally consistent. It doesn\\'t make more sense than the mainstream narrative. It does not outcompete the mainstream narrative in the idea marketplace. In fact, no two believers in the inside job conspiracy seem to actually agree on all of the details. It only seeks to poke holes in the mainstream account, and refuses to acknowledge its own failures.\\n\\nI believe most conspiracy theorists do not understand the full mainstream narrative because it is difficult, complicated, goes back many years, and requires knowledge of geopolitics that can\\'t really be grasped by youtube videos with scary music. The alternative theories are vague, exciting, make you feel like you have special knowledge, and are infinitely more appealing to people who are intellectually lazy. \\n\\nAm I saying that every detail we know or think we know about 9/11 is correct? No. Am I saying the US is perfect, or even innocent in this? No. It was blowback from our foreign policy in the Middle East. \\n\\nI am saying that 19 Arabs hijacked 4 planes and crashed them on 9/11/2001. This directly resulted in damage to the Pentagon, the collapse of WTCs 1, 2, and 7, and extensive damage to the rest of the WTC complex, and required no explosives and no cooperation from the US government. \\n\\nIn 13 years, the conspiracy crowd has not come up with a competing narrative that more accurately or more logically describes what happened that day.\\n\\nChange my view. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Even if that is an exaggeration, you\\'ll find this fear to be near the top of the list of human phobias. Why, then, do we FORCE children in school through this? Not only do I think that forcing children to face this fear DOES NOT make them any more used to it than they were before, but it actually causes PTSD in regards to public speaking and social situations later in life and makes it less likely that the average person will be willing to engage in public speaking when they actually have something to say. I\\'m not saying public speaking shouldn\\'t be a part of school, but it should be a choice for the natural public speakers and should not used as an initiation practice into public life or adulthood. I am mainly speaking from my own personal experience when I say that being forced to stand in front of a crowd of people and lie through my teeth (spouting off words I don\\'t really understand or care about at a deep level) caused severe psychological damage and panic attacks. I don\\'t see any virtue in getting a frightened child to perform this act when they are not ready, and is there any evidence that doing this actually helps people or makes them stronger, smarter, or more capable? \\n\\n****EDIT\\nI\\'d like to thank everyone for your replies, now I have a more accurate picture of the cultural attitudes surrounding this issue.

You and I both know that being forced into these situations can cause lasting trauma and does not help us get over these experiences. The best we can do is suppress them and pretend they helped us when they didn\\'t. There are things in life that aren\\'t avoidable, but to artificially induce these threatening situations on a child before they are psychologically ready to handle them, without proper care and training beforehand, can cause lasting effects. My argument from the beginning is that there is a reason why surveys show public speaking to be feared more than death. Unlike math, unlike science, unlike other subjects that can be done on an individual level--being placed before an assembly of witnesses triggers one of humanity\\'s deepest fears, which is fear of ostracism. Reading out loud and gym class, other activities where you are performing before others can place a child in the mindset that they are about to be socially ostracized. That can cause serious trauma, that stuff runs really deep in the psyche. Children should instead be taught with care and more adequate preparation to stand in front of others, how to deal with pressure and the perception of judgment, than just being thrown into it cold turkey.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It\\'s typically a trait of giving their full attention and focus to completing a task as quickly and effectively as possible, getting the most information/bonding/engagement from a conversation, or paying the most attention they can to an event or surroundings where, while there, it could clearly or even possibly be beneficial to observe and understand as much as they can about what is going on.\\n\\n\\n* Mouth:  While not always as indicative as the eyes, a mouth that is almost always gaping open (not just slightly) while not eating or talking, especially in a manner that they seem unaware or uninterested in, is, in my experience, a sign of stupidity. \\nExcluding people who slightly have their mouth open (because their physiology makes it unatuaral to stay completely shut, or they can\\'t nose breathe), how many smart people have you met with dominately gaping open mouths all the time.\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government weilds considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism\\'s tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare.\" These interventions include food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, and other features of a social safety net.\\n \\nHowever, I oppose socialism, which is defined as \"the social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.\"\\n\\n## Section II: Types of \"socialism\"\\n\\n\"Social ownership\" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.\" \\n\\nCuba, USSR, Maoist China, and North Korea are examples of command economies, in which a central planner manages and directs the means of production. Some socialists view these nations as examples of \"state socialism.\" However, others feel that \"state socialism\" only exists when the government is representing the will of the people (making state socialism an indirect form of socialism), meaning they feel only Cuba is somewhat representative of true state socialism. Some have derided the USSR as exemplifying \"state capitalism,\" but I dispute that characterization given that the USSR had a non-capitalist command economy, and \"state capitalism\" is a more accurate descriptor of China\\'s current political economic configuration (post Maoist China, after Deng Xiaoping\\'s dual-track market reforms). \\n\\nHowever, modern day socialists almost unanimously denounce indirect socialism, and prefer direct socialism and workplace democracy rather than state socialism and central planning, especially when the government is authoritarian. Modern day socialists tend to favor decentralized planning in allocating inputs and outputs. This can be done through cybernetics (in the 1970s, Chile attempted a computer-controlled economy to coordinate economic inputs and outputs), negotiated coordination, or participatory planning in which producers and consumers, or their representatives, negotiate the quality and quantity of what is to be produced. Participatory planning is based around consumer and worker guilds. Other socialists, however, prefer retaining market-based distribution, but would want to transform all firms into worker cooperatives of government sponsored enterprises. Yugioslavia had a system of market socialism for a while in which GSEs competed with each other. Some socialists, like Richard D. Wolff, feel that a socialist economy can have both planning and market distribution. Some socialists subscribe to the heterodox Marxist paradigm in economics, but there are non-Marxist socialists as well. \\n\\nI\\'m fine with small scale market socialism (worker coops being formed voluntarily under a market system), but I\\'m more critical of socialists who wish to dismantle the market system and replace it with central and/or decentralized planning. I\\'m also critical of socialists who want to forcibly institute full-scale market socialism. \\n\\n## Section III: Distinguishing welfare policies from \"socialism\"\\n\\nI think that a lot of self-described democratic socialists (including Senator Bernie Sanders) are in fact social democrats: they just got the terminology mixed up. Regulations + a safety net =/= socialism. Socialism is when the means of production are commonly owned, through worker cooperatives, or through nationalization (this is indirect socialism in which the government owns the industry, but the government is assumed to represent the people). The NHS is an example of \"socialized\" medicine because the British governments owns and operates the hospitals, and doctors are government employees. However, single-payer healthcare isn\\'t \"socialist\" because while healthcare funding is public, the hospitals are privately owned and operated. \\n\\nSo technically, Scandinavian nations aren\\'t more \"socialist\" than the U.S.; rather, they just have a stronger welfare state to deal with inequality and other market failures. Welfare policies can exist in both capitalist systems and socialist systems. For example, many market socialists support a system characterized by worker cooperatives operating in a market based system, and workers who go out of business get caught by the safety net (and have unemployment insurance, etc). \\n\\n## Section IV: Why market capitalism is a good basic framework for an economic system\\n\\nIn his works, Adam Smith does an excellent job linking private interest to public good. When economic actors pursue their private interests, they are bettering the public good, even when they are unaware of doing so. According to Adam Smith, on a societal level, self-interest is more consistent motivation than kindness and altruism, and the best organizing principle for a wealthy and stable society.\\n\\nVoluntary exchange creates an economy in which economic actors, out of self interest, do what other economic actors want. For example, a baker may invest in improving the quality of his bread to compete with other breakers for consumers in order to maximize profits. The consumer, in pursuing his or her self-interest and seeking to maximize utility, will benefit from having access to the highest quality bread.\\n\\nVoluntary exchange is an efficient organizing mechanism without a coordinator. The invisible hand of the market matches supply and demand through the mechanism of prices. Through free-exchanges, the accumulation  of private choices increases productivity and the efficient utilization of resources. \\n\\nI believe that private property and markets distribution benefit society. Markets can be great at allocating resources among competing uses (via supply and demand), and private ownership over the factors of production provides incentives for innovation, specialization, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). Higher growth is good, because while it may lead to higher relative inequality in the absence of social democratic policies, it gets people out of absolute poverty. Remember, growth is both output and national income (and expenditure), so as a country grows, the people of that country get richer. Economic growth helps mitigates the effects of scarcity as our capacity to produce more goods expands. \\n\\nIt\\'s important, however, to ensure that the gains are widely distributed, and this can be achieved through proper government policy. It\\'s not necessarily the case that capitalism leads to exorbitant inequality. Moreover, governments are needed to make sure that growth is sustainable, and doesn\\'t cause exorbitant environmental degradation. This can again be achieved through prudent policies. I don\\'t see how socialist economies would foster the levels of long-term growth we\\'ve observed in capitalist economies (an increase in potential growth occurs when we see a rise in physical stock, growth in the size of the active labor force, growth in the quality of labor, and technological progress and innovation driving productivity improvements...capitalism incentivizes all of these)\\n\\nIn a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there\\'s consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn\\'t cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn\\'t evil; capitalism is honest in that regard. This doesn\\'t mean that people should be self-interested on an individual level, and shouldn\\'t be concerned for others. In fact, Adam Smith, wrote extensively of how people shouldn\\'t be self interested as individuals. But what it means is that self-interest is a good organizing principle for an economy: consumers maximize their utility by demanding the products they want, and self-interested producers will produce the products consumers want. This is the principle of the invisible hand. Also profit seeking isn\\'t inherently harmful to society. With a higher profits, a company can reinvest its earnings in organic expansion (through investing in technology that can result in dynamic efficiency and lower long-term costs), and ideally improving product quality and quantity (provided that the the market is competitive). \\n\\nYes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).\\n\\nTraditionally, when human laborers were displaced due to technological improvements, they sought out new skills and found employment in new sectors. While the displaced workers suffered in the short term, society benefited. Technological improvements vastly improved productivity and efficiency, increasing output, and allowed us to economize on human labor to produce higher-level goods and services. \\n\\nFrom a great comment I read on reddit earlier: \"Economic progress comes not so much we create jobs,  but destroy jobs we don\\'t need anymore. As mechanization made farming cheaper, reducing the price of food, consumers had more money to demand other things, and workers shifted industries to provide those new things. New innovations don\\'t happen at once, and happen over time. Workers have to learn new skills and be unemployed for a while. And while unemployment is bad, these labor transitions are worse. These labor transitions are the price we pay for economic progress. To prevent them would be to halt growth, innovation, and the reduction of absolute poverty. Job destruction also indicates to young people where the new jobs will be. We\\'ve gone from farm jobs, to industrial jobs, to service jobs, to knowledge jobs. And market signals can indicate to people what sort of skills they should be investing in and where the jobs of the future should be. Planners, both centralized and decentralized planners, do not have these signals.\"\\n\\n## Section V: Critique of the Marxist conception of exploitation \\nI have yet to see a compelling argument of how a purely socialist system (in which the means of ownership are completely democratically owned and distributed by working class) would be better in these regards. I\\'ve also written extensively on reddit about the labor theory of value, the theory upon which Marx based on his conception of exploitation under capitalism. Marx posits that the fact that workers don\\'t own the means of production enables the bourgeoisie to forcibly extract surplus value from labor, which is then used to accumulate capital. Workers are given merely subsistence wages, and are not fully compensated for the value of their work. This, according to Marx, creates powerful contradictions in the capitalist system, as workers are unable to purchase the goods supplied by capitalists, leading to recessions in which the proletariat grow in numbers, and the bourgeoisie continue to shrink, eventually causing capitalism to implode on itself. This is summarized in the equation C-M-C for workers, as Marx believes laborers become essentially commoditized, and M-C-M for capitalists. \\n\\nBut, the thing is, most economists across many schools have agreed that goods don\\'t have intrinsic value: the value of goods are subjectively determined by supply and demand (and this is how it should be: allocative efficiency and consumer sovereignty allow for a democratic economy). So in the real world, there is only exchange value, no intrinsic \"labor-value,\" so the contradiction doesn\\'t exist. That\\'s why in the real world, recessions in advanced nations haven\\'t lead to revolutions by the working class to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" \\n\\nIt\\'s certainly the case that widening inequality can perpetuate and exacerbate recessions (by denying consumers the purchasing power they need to purchase the goods supplied by producers). However the causes of inequality are widespread, and are much more diverse than \"firms exploiting workers\" (although that\\'s a factor). And excessive inequality can be corrected for through a robust safety net. And because there\\'s no contradiction inherent in the system, welfare policies don\\'t simply postpone a proletariat revolution as some modern Marxists claim. I find John Maynard Keynes\\' explanation for economic fluctuations to be more compelling. \\n\\nAlso, we can observe that in the real world, profits always don\\'t go up, and wages don\\'t always go down: when we have competition, businesses are forced to pay workers very close to what they contribute to the firm\\'s bottom line. In a monopsonistic or oligopsonistic labor market, however, strong government regulations like minimum wages and collective bargaining protections are necessary.\\n\\nSo that\\'s why I\\'m not inherently against the private ownership of the means of production. I don\\'t see that as being inherently exploitative (which pretty much all socialists do: you have market socialists, for example, who prefer retaining market distribution, but would want to transform business structures into worker owned cooperatives to end private ownership in order to end what they feel is an exploitative system that inherently abuses and alienates workers). I think it\\'s fine for a business owner or manager (who isn\\'t a worker) to make a profit, it\\'s fine for not every business entity to be a worker coop: after all, managers should be compensated for coordinating the other factors of production (land, labor, physical capital) and for risking their own financial capital in the business venture (esp if it\\'s a sole proprietorship or general partnership). Moreover, we need to consider paying business owners (in non-corporate entities) the opportunity cost of managing the firm rather than being employees elsewhere. The profit incentive is also a great incentive for innovation, creativity, and leadership, as entrepreneurs will be motivated to develop products and services that they feel consumers will want. The profit incentive encourages entrepreneurs to solve problems faced by consumers, other firms, or the government; to exploit an original idea or invention; to fill a gap in an emerging market; or to produce an existing product more effective or more cheaply.\\n\\n## Section VI: Merits of market-based distribution \\n\\nThe consumers are ideally sovereign in a capitalist system - they ultimately get to decide what is produced and what is not, and by whom, with their demonstrated preferences. The successful entrepreneur has to play mind-reader, making informed, calculated guesses as to whether their project will be profitable. If it turns out that consumers think the entrepreneur\\'s application of capital to be a waste, they do not patronize the business, and it will fail in order for that capital to be reallocated to something consumers actually want. This is the invisible hand of the market at work. In the real world, this is a bit nuanced due to circularity and \"controlled volition,\" since non-price competition (via advertising, branding, marketing, etc) can influence consumers\\' preferences. But even then, consumers cast dollar votes in favor of the products they wish to purchase, and do have a voice, even in monopolistic markets (while the demand curve is relatively inelastic for monopolies, if monopolies charge too high of a price, consumers will stop purchasing the monopoly\\'s product, and this is important to note).\\n\\nCritics of capitalism may often assert that it\\'s better to have a planned economy (either through central planning, or decentralized planning) b/c the products and services produced under capitalism don\\'t go a long way in improving our quality of life. We can deride markets as institutions that promote consumerism and materialism, but keep in mind allocative efficiency (producing the goods consumers want at the right quantity, regardless of what they are) is a central goal of economics, “the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.” And the products and services that are under-produced in pure free-market systems are often goods that the private sector is inherently inefficient inefficient at producing anyway, such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, libraries, etc. These are goods that the government needs to provide. So you can have the government provide these goods while retaining the capitalist system: the fact that the private sector can\\'t adequately supply isn\\'t proof that capitalism needs to be overthrown completely. You can have a mixed economy, which is superior to both laissez-faire capitalism and pure socialism.\\n\\nSocialists who are opposed to markets do not take into account the economic calculation problem in the face of scarcity. They also overlook how humans respond to incentives, and how the capitalist system provides people with incentives to allocate goods efficiently and to innovate. Capitalism also empowers individuals: consumer sovereignty, dollar votes, etc, voluntary exchange. \\n\\nThe historical collapse of socialism in the 20th-century history of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China was due, in part, to their inefficiencies caused by information problems of centrally planned complex economies, motivational problems of self-interested people in societies purporting to transcend individualism, innovation problems of change-resistant bureaucracies, and social problems of individual liberty subordinated to coercive, repressive, and corrupt central planning. I\\'m also not convinced that decentralized planning would be superior to market-based forms of distribution (in which the price mechanism sends signals to producers to produce the goods consumers wants, and signals to consumers to ration goods based on supply and demand). I just feel that there are too many information failures that occur with planning, especially in large-scale economies. \\n\\n## Section VII: Role of the state in social democracies \\n\\nI want to clarify: I think that unfettered capitalism is a barbaric system. It beats pure socialism, but it\\'s still terrible. Free markets with very limited governments would fail in many ways: poor health and education services, low state benefits and pensions and, perhaps the worst in a civilized society, an unfair distribution of income. Most of these problems do not exist if you are one of the richer members of society, but if you are poorer you have little to nothing. So I oppose laissez-faire capitalism, and I definitely oppose the crony capitalism and corporatism we see in the U.S. I definitely feel that our country needs to move sharply to the left on economics. \\n\\nEssentially, I subscribe to the market, regulations, and the welfare state, and would like to see America move more towards a Scandavian model - stronger safety nets, less income and wealth inequality, higher economic mobility, \"free\" higher education and daycare, paid maternity leave, universal single-payer healthcare, etc.\\n\\nIn my view, it\\'s essential for capitalist economies to have regulations to maximize human welfare (market efficiency is not the only goal of society). I definitely see government as being a source of good and an instrument to improve human welfare. Of course this does not mean that government can\\'t get it wrong and can\\'t harm human welfare. Unfortunately, this does happens at times, such as when governments guarantee bank bailouts. And I actually like the \"flexicurity\" system of Denmark, in which the labor market is very flexible (people are hired and fired easily) and loosely regulated, but workers are cushioned by extensive unemployment benefits. \\n\\nBut the government can be a powerful source of good, and this is important: this is why I\\'m sharply to the left of U.S. Democrats, and to the left of European Christian Democrats (who prefer a social market economy similar to what exists in Germany). But I\\'m definitely to the right of people who want to completely abolish capitalism, and feel that it has no redeeming factor, and that it shouldn\\'t be retained to any degree. I view Sweden, Norway, etc., as the end game. I don\\'t think we should go further to abolish private property and the private ownership of the means of production, for example. \\n\\nI just think that the problematic excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don\\'t work well (such as healthcare: I support \"single-payer healthcare\" like what exists in Western Europe: I particularly like France\\'s system). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in smoothing out the business cycle, such as through pursuing Keynesian expansionary fiscal and monetary policies during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren\\'t too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations (tackling monopolies and oligopolies), providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade or carbon taxes to address climate change. \\n\\nMoreover, \"free-trade\" policies that don\\'t include strong labor and environmental protections lead to environmental degradation, the depletion of natural resources, and exploitation of labor (through labor arbitrage and race to the bottom). Governments need to ensure that trade policies have these protections in place. Also while the government can engage in trade, it should protect infant industries and sunset industries from foreign competition, and should focus more on dynamic efficiency rather than static efficiency. The government should also invest heavily in public education and vocational programs to improve the employment prospects of workers as they lose their jobs due to globalization and automation, and reduce the skills gap, and improve occupational mobility and people\\'s income potentials.\\n\\nThe government should also guarantee a minimum standard of living through robust minimum wages, or a guaranteed minimum income. I\\'m also down with organic market socialism, via empowering worker and consumer cooperatives through tax incentives (I like Bernie Sanders\\' proposal for this, and Italy has a cool system under which unemployed workers can receive public funds to form a cooperative). Also keep in mind Bernie Sanders misidentifies himself: he\\'s not a socialist in the strictest sense (he doesn\\'t want to abolish private ownership of the means of production), and is much more a European social democrat (who supports regulated capitalism + very strong safety nets).\\n\\nRegulations and targeted government interventions in the market are key. Capitalist societies where there\\'s strong worker organization, to counterbalance executive power, tend to do well. Capitalist societies where there\\'s strict campaign finance regulation in place to separate government and corporations tend to do well (to avoid crony capitalism, corporatism, etc). Capitalist societies where taxation is strong and loopholes rare tend to do well. Shoot, I doubt we\\'d even know what a middle class is without capitalism. It\\'s just a matter of putting necessary systems in place to check the accumulation of extreme power and to isolate economic power from other forms of power.\\n\\nIt makes sense to have some income inequality, and pay more for jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, and pose a lot of risk. This is to offset the costs of training and to incentivize people to take on jobs that are dangerous or require training. With diversified levels of educational attainment, different years of training, and other factors, one\\'s marginal product of labor may demand a higher wage than someone else. Also, under capitalism, some businesses succeed, and others fails. So inequality resulting from that is natural. However, excessive income and wealth inequality should be curbed by the state, and the state should ensure an equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcomes. \\n\\nI genuinely believe a capitalist mixed economy is the best way to go, better than both having a system in which the means of production are completely owned by the public, or a capitalist system in which the government plays a minimal role.\\n\\n## Section VIII: Critique of Market Socialism\\n\\nMarket socialism \"is contrasted with social democratic policies implemented within capitalist market economies: while social democracy aims to achieve greater economic stability and equality through policy measures such as taxes, subsidies and social welfare programs; market socialism aims to achieve similar goals through changing patterns of enterprise ownership and management.\"\\n\\nI\\'m against pure market socialism. Pure market socialism isn’t ideal: while it allows workers to own the factors of production and the goods they produce, forcing everyone who wants to start a business to form a cooperative might not be efficient. It’s better to have capitalism where people have the choice to form whatever business entity they want, whether it be a partnership, LLC, sole proprietorship, corporation, or worker or consumer cooperative. Worker cooperatives tend to be more risk averse b/c workers have more to lose if the firm fails. \\n\\n## Section IX: Rebuttal to socialist critiques of social democracy\\n\\nGenuine socialists criticize the Scandinavian system with the following analogy: \"Social democracy is like when you have a festering wound, but you use medication to make all of the symptoms go away to make you feel great. You can live a happy life, and be oblivious to your pain, but your wound was never truly healed. You are still slave who is chained down, and while the chains have been loosened so much you don\\'t really feel them anymore, they still exist. You\\'re not truly free.\"\\n\\nI have a few problems with this analogy: as mentioned before, I disagree that private ownership over the means of production is inherently exploitative and abusive. So while the chains CAN exist under a capitalist system, they need not exist. \\n\\nAlso I\\'m extremely skeptical of the claim that capitalism is inherently linked with racism, institutionalized sexism, and discrimination toward LGBT individuals when discrimination lowers efficiency by prevent workers from achieving their potential, and being placed in the occupations for which they are most suited. Japan is a highly capitalist nation, and part of Shinzo Abe’s structural reforms is to reduce patriarchal barriers in the workplace that discourage women from seeking and attaining gainful employment. Women’s rights and capitalism aren’t antithetical, and it’s bizarre to claim that they are.\\n\\n## Section X: Capitalism on a global scale\\n\\nOn a global scale, there are also good critiques to dependency theory by Stephen Haggard and Peter Evans, and how capitalism doesn\\'t inherently promote neocolonialism and dependency (using the successes of the East Asian tigers, Brazil, and India as examples). \\n\\nDependency theory is \"the notion that resources flow from a \\'periphery\\' of poor and underdeveloped states to a \"core\" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the \\'world system.\\' Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.\"\\n\\nDependency theory is essentially an application of Marxism to international political economy. The problem with it is how it can’t tell us why East Asian countries succeeded. It overestimates the power of structure, underestimates ability of different countries to break out of their cycle of dependency and grow. Countries should look beyond their own economic problems, and figure out ways to redefine their relationship with the world economies. \\n\\nLook at the East Asian tigers: South Korea was as impoverished as many African nations in the 1950s, but it made strategic choices and engaged in developmental policies. It defined its relationship with the global economy, and restructured its relationship with foreign capital. Other currently impoverished countries do have choices to improve their economic standing, and that shouldn\\'t be overlooked. South Korea built institutions embedded in local and historical context. It set up market institutions, such as a system of property rights. Institutions were autonomous, not captured by interests. As a result, state agencies were aware of private sector interests. This enabled the state to allocate capital efficiently across sectors, helping turn South Korea into a manufacturing powerhouse. South Korea quickly switched from import-substitution industrialization to export-led growth. (Countries stuck in the ISI model saw less success). \"Capitalism\" didn\\'t prevent South Korea from breaking out of dire poverty and succeeding. Similar cases with Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore. \\n\\nMoreover, colonialism and imperialism are more tied to \"power\" rather than the economic system of a country. It just happened to be the case that the countries who became world powers were capitalist. On a theoretical level, capitalism and imperialism are contradictory systems of economic and political organization. But many socialists conflate the two, and blame capitalism and the trade system for the exploitation of poor people, mass famines, etc. When in fact, the blame should be placed on imperialism and empire, not capitalism. Capitalism is a system of the free exchange of goods and services between individuals on a voluntary basis under the rule of law and in a system of private property rights. Theoretically, capitalism promotes voluntary exchange through which all parties are better off. \\n\\n\"Imperialism, by contrast, is a system of relations based upon power. Essentially, it\\'s a system in which certain groups of privileged people in one part of the world are able to extract unearned income from people in other parts of the world through the use of exploitative power relations, usually with the help of local collaborates. The key to this is using political power (esp military power) to establish economic relations are involuntary and exploitative. An example is  how the United Fruit Company (backed by the U.S. federal government) was able to establish exploitative relations with people in parts of Central America, such as Honduras and Guatemala. The important thing is to realize is that while these were profit making enterprises, they were not true commercial capitalist businesses in the real sense of the term. The profits that they gain were not due to free competition or voluntary cooperation with willing buyers and sellers, but the use of political power. So the problem here isn\\'t\\'\"capitalism.\\' Imperialism is not and never has been the highest stage of capitalism. For one thing, empires have existed long before capitalism came into existence. Capitalism and imperialism are not complementary but contradictory.\"\\n\\nAnd remember, during the Cold War, the USSR engaged in imperialism and it had a non-capitalist a command economy. Moreover, on a theoretical level, colonialism is more associated with mercantilism rather than liberal capitalism; under mercantilism (which preceded capitalism), colonialism was justified as a means for the mother country to attain a trade-surplus. When Adam Smith wrote \"The Wealth of Nations,\" he was actually opposing mercantilism and protectionism. \\n\\nIt\\'s important to differentiate the current structure of capitalist nations from capitalism as an ideal type/theoretical system and how they were structured historically. The extent that capitalist countries were successful in uplifting their people is the degree to which those countries implemented genuine capitalism, as prescribed by economic theory. In cases where this didn\\'t happen (government bailouts, market failures due to discrimination against women, improper provision of public and merit goods, etc), these countries weren\\'t successful in providing broad-based growth. If a country with a capitalist economy engages in imperialism or colonialism, then that doesn\\'t necessarily mean that capitalism and imperialism are inherently tied together, and that capitalism needs to be overthrown for imperialism to stop. What it means is that a so-called capitalist country isn\\'t engaging in honest capitalist practices, just as how many socialists rightly condemned the USSR and Maoist China as not implement \"true socialism.\" \\n\\nIf we started conflating theory with practice, then the socialist defense that \"you can\\'t say socialism never worked in the real world b/c no country has truly been socialist\" would be obsolete. \\n\\n## Section XI: Capitalism, post-scarcity, and the future \\n\\nThat being said, I’m not saying that capitalism is the absolute best system. It’s just the least bad economic system at the moment. And if we achieve post-scarcity in the future due to technological innovation, then we can transcend capitalism and enter into a socialist like system. However, as long as scarcity exists, then capitalism is the least bad system we have to allocate goods and services as efficiently as possible. And I really want to stress how important proper regulations are: our economies will certainly collapse if inequality isn’t dealt with it, if we don’t prepare ourselves for massive technological unemployment due to automation, if we don’t deal with climate change, etc. So we need to save capitalism from itself (because mixed capitalism is currently the best system we have), and make capitalism work for the general public, not just the top 0.01% percent. And to do that, we need to look to the successes of the Scandinavian model and strongly consider robust investments in childcare, healthcare, maternity leave, public education, minimum wage laws, and collective bargaining protections.'},\n {'title': 'CMV: Piracy is wrong',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2pqpjh',\n  'selftext': \"A lot of people on the internet, especially on Reddit, seem to really like piracy.

Even worse than the fellow black people trying to get out - like Gatsby, are the police, trying to keep the \" Black rats\" in the trap. \"Judges hanging niggas, incorrect bails, for direct sales, my intellect prevails, from a hanging cross, with nails.\"\\n\\nThe mentality of being born into a racist system, trying to keep you down, combined with the constant drumming into you what the American dream is, motivates people to do terrible things. But I think that Hiphop deserves more attention, and credit, for being a modern day retelling of the flawed American Dream, and Racist System, and what happens when they meet.\\n\\n\"He see it as another felony drug arrest, any day could be the day he picks the wrong thug to test, slug through the vest, shot in the street **for pulling heat on a father whose baby gotta eat**\"'},\n {'title': 'CMV: The residing powers in the U.S. do not want to support their veterans, as veterans, aside from militia, would be the best-trained in military-grade weaponry to support a fomenting revolution.',\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2pqdv6',\n  'selftext': 'I trust my title will catch the eye, though IMO it is hardly sensational. \\n\\nThe influx of military-grade equipment into the arsenals of our local police forces, who lack proper training to use them (many articles have covered these two clauses in depth and I need not delve further), serve as a means to re-purpose Iraq War (et al.) expenditures, as well as increase police effectiveness.\\n\\nHowever, we have seen countless examples of the misuse of these instruments as tools of oppression, not protection (see \"The Rise of the Warrior Cop\" or [other examples](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/9/police-militarizationswattechnology.html) of police militarization). \\n\\nAll oligarchs, aristocrats, despots, corrupt politicians, and corporate superpowers fear revolution- whether or not one is brewing in the U.S. is irrelevant.

Things that can and do reach the front page(or are tangentially connected to it through things like the comments of such threads).\\n\\nNow, the largest complaint I see is that the community is a \"hate group\", which seems a bit silly to me. Who are they discriminating against? White Males? As far as I know, that\\'s what the majority of the community is composed of.\\n\\nSecondly, often times the content they highlight are offensive jokes, and these statements are defended with statements like \"its just a joke.\" This makes the accusation that SRS is a hate group to me even stranger, given that the vast majority of the comments in the comment section tend to be similar jokes, just at the expense of those who mocked the disadvantaged(or and assumed image of them). Can those who like making jokes at the expense of others not take what they dish out?\\n\\nThirdly, and probably most importantly, SRS is, in my view, a very necessary force of balance. People like to say they are a force of censorship, but I don\\'t agree with that. First and foremost, for all the complaints about brigading, very few of the content they highlight is downvoted into obscurity. Beyond that, Freedom of Speech is only guaranteed by the US Government, but not by private companies like Reddit, or massive populations like Reddit\\'s user base. Being downvoted isn\\'t censorship. You expressed your sentiment, and the community rejected it. Nothing was denied beyond validation. Reddit is an immensely useful medium and interface for connecting to people all over the world, and it receives new users every day. When memes like Opinion Puffin basically degenerate into a way for people to seek validation for racist and sexist beliefs, and this stuff gets upvoted to the front page from being on one of the sites most populated subs, it can give the wrong idea as to what kind of community actually uses this site, or give someone a good reason for not joining, which is sad, because social connection is exactly what Reddit was obviously designed to foster.\\n\\nAnyway, those are my main reasons for my current position.

Every day we get a ten minute break and take a walk around our corporate block.  I\\'ve been waiting all morning to tell my friend an anecdote that had occurred on the previous evening, and since we both sit stifling in silence at our desks the rest of the day, I get very expressive and animated in the telling.  I drop a couple of sh#ts and f#ckings for emphasis at the height of my tale, and my friend disrupts me to ask me not to use that language because there are other people nearby.  She\\'s visibly embarrassed.\\n\\nI\\'ve used this kind of language with her before, even though, at 30+, she still uses euphemisms like \"poop\" and only recently realized that \"maroon\" was a stand-in for moron.  We\\'re both adults, and she\\'s never indicated that she minded.  But apparently she minds when other people are around, because they may judge her for it.\\n\\nThis trivial issue turns out to be a highly sensitive one.  My father used to slam his fists on the table and completely shut down a previously happy conversation if I accidentally let a \"bad\" word slip.  It made me feel like a villain, and even though my friend was more reasonable in her request, it invoked flashbacks to my black sheep days in the family household.\\n\\nThis inspired an argument, wherein I argued that I don\\'t care if people judge me for my language choice in public.  If you enter into private property, it\\'s appropriate to censor your language according to the preferences of the host, but in public you should feel free to be yourself and learn to respect other\\'s differences.  \\n\\nShe accused me of not caring about other people\\'s feelings, because I make a distinction between words that are personally offensive and words that are superficially offensive.  If someone doesn\\'t like a curse word simply because it alludes, in the abstract, to something literal which by their belief system is crude and inappropriate, that is an affront which is, in my view, not genuinely hurtful or harmful.\\n\\nI make an exception for words which could be construed as a personal attack, such as racist, sexist or homophobic terminology.  If someone hears me using words like b#tch, n#gger or f#g, they may feel **personally** attacked because such words have historically been used to judge and denigrate who they are as individuals.\\n\\nMy friend contends that there is no difference.  She argues that if a civilized person is offended by an inelegant term, then it is personal.  Their feelings about polite etiquette are as valid as someone else\\'s pride in who they are.  She is also of the camp that children should be protected from language because \"it takes a village to raise a child\". I challenged her to explain how \"bad\" words could hurt a child. She said it makes the world seem like an angry place.  \\n\\n(Interestingly, she tends to interpret the world through a lens of fear that I don\\'t.  Point in case: I showed her a dance routine on youtube by LesTwins which I found wonderfully playful.  She thought the dance was representing a scene of violence.)\\n\\nI told my friend that it was unfair of her to restrict my behavior so that *she* wouldn\\'t be judged for it.

Some also consider age of the child, difference in income between parents, standard of living adjustments, etc. \\n\\nIn theory I get it, but the implications in practice really bother me and I think the basis behind the laws regulating child support calculation are a little outdated and unfair. \\n\\nHere's a summary of my objections: \\n\\n* Above a certain amount why should income be taken into account? For example, let's consider two friends Jane and Anna. Jane has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $25k per year and Anna has a baby with her ex-boyfriend who earns $150k per year. Assuming both women have similar incomes and lifestyles before children, most child support calculations would award Anna much more child support than Jane. But why? Is Anna's child more deserving of money than Jane's child?\\n\\n* Why should calculations assume a relationship or marriage? Many child support calculations are based on the income that would have been dedicated to the child if the parents lived together. If a woman gets pregnant from a one night stand or a non-serious relationship, why should there be any assumption by the courts that the parents would have lived together and raised the child together? A married couple living together with children spend their income differently than single people without children. So why should a relationship be assumed and considered when it did not exist in the first place?\\n\\n* Why is standard of living important? Some child support calculations take into account the accustomed or increased standard of living when calculating support amounts. Let's be honest here, is there ever really a need for $5k per month in child support? Just because someone is wealthy, why does that mean they are automatically expected to provide a high level of financial support to their children. Where exactly is that money going? In most cases it isn't all going to the child and I think that is problematic. The point of child support money is for support of the child, not the creation of an expensive lifestyle for the child and custodial parent. \\n\\nIn my opinion, a basic formula should be developed (adjusted for cost of living by area) that accounts for the average amount required to support a child's basic monthly needs at varying age levels. This amount would take into account food, transportation, clothing, medical and other miscellaneous expenses. The child support amount could be then simply read off a table rather than dedicating time and resources into courts and legal decisions. \\n\\nIf this amount is more than 15% of monthly net income, the child support paying parent would be limited to pay 15% as support for that child. A parent shouldn't be struggling financially to pay their own bills in order to be able to keep up with child support payments. \\n\\nFor parents where this amount is less than 15% of monthly net income, they would pay the set amount as given by the formula.\\n\\nIf parents have 50/50 joint custody, there would be no child support awarded, because both parents should be equally supporting the child. For other custody situations the child support amount would be calculated down or up based on custody percentage. \\n\\nSo am I missing something here? To me what I've described above seems to be a much fairer system than the way child support is currently calculated. So please, CMV. \\n \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Here\\'s how I see it:\\n\\n1. The media is dying to find more to print, and anything you say will add to their word bank.  If you\\'d like them to move on to a new topic or target, defending yourself in public will just make that take longer.  It\\'ll pop back up every so often, but if you respond each time it\\'ll prolong the episode.\\n\\n2. Yes, staying silent will make it so you won\\'t get \"your side\" of the story out there, but there\\'s really nothing you can say that can\\'t come back and bite you in the butt.  In my experience, the media frequently gets a quote wrong, and that can sink your odds of winning in the court of public opinion.  But there\\'s also a decent chance that you\\'ll misspeak and have to correct yourself (either on the spot or after the fact).  *That* will certainly knock you down a few levels instead of helping you climb out of the pit you\\'re in.\\n\\n3.  Denying the allegations puts you in the awkward position of calling someone a liar. And not just someone in the abstract, someone who everyone knows and feels sympathy for.  Personally denying the allegations are true puts your face and your voice in front of the \"these people are lying\" message, and that\\'s not going to do you any favors.\\n\\nSo there it is! Convince me that I don\\'t understand how PR works and set me straight!\\n\\nEdit 1: My assumption is that people generally equate *not saying something* with *having something to hide.*  I\\'m not trying to make a judgement call as to how effective this strategy would be if he was guilty.  The inspiration for this post mostly came after I reflected on how I would handle being falsely accused and I settled on this course of action for now.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In the U.K, immigration is consistently in the papers, our leaders are continually speaking about it, and it is *always* discussed on political shows such as Question Time. It's become so popular that we have elected UKIP, a right-wing party who advocates strong immigration policy, as our European representative, not to mention their continued growth in successful elections around the country.\\n\\nThe rise of right wing parties advocating stronger immigration control can be seen in many other countries - France, Germany, Spain etc, and these parties are all gaining popularity.\\n\\nFirstly, I think that as we live in Democracy, the will of the people must be heard. If immigration is consistently polling as the number 1 issue people want changing, if the rise of stricter immigration policy parties continue, and if people continue to protest (as shown in Germany recently), the issue *must* be adressed by government.\\n\\nI feel that isn't particularly the case. If we look to Germany recently - the protest was organized by very shady people, but the elected officials immediately branded those whom worry about immigration as in the same boat as the 'nazis in pinstripes' who organized the protest. Look at the recent comments made in France - people who worry about immigration are 'spiteful'. There's a continued backlash in many of these countries by the elected, which is often presented in ways similar to above - evoke themes of racism, patriotism (often seen as a dirty word in Europe), xenophobia in relation to anti-immigration worries in an effort to simply brush it away. If we take an extreme example - Look at sweden. The fear to criticize immigration is so strong that there are numerous examples where when newspapers report on crimes committed by immigrants - the blurred out, anonymized photos they use in their articles are actually *whitewashed*. As in, made to look as if the immigrants are from European descent. Sweden simply refuses to have any form of discussion on the issue.\\n\\nNot only do I find this problematic (and wonder if these parties are beginning to rely on an immigrant vote - sort of how the left in the US relies on the hispanic &amp; black vote), I feel it's counterproductive. When the government brushes aside these valid concerns, the populous who do worry will feel embittered and turn to their only remaining solution - these right wing parties.\\n\\nSo, my first two points are - that, as a democracy, the will of people must be adressed, and that the popularity of the issue and the rise of certain political parties across the european spectrum highlight how much of an issue this is. Further, there's a fear by politicians to adress these concerns, whether they be it simply for being labelled as racist or for some other reason, and that some politicians conversely use the labels just mentioned to actively shut down discussion.\\n\\nMy final point would be of that of culture. When I read threads and discussions about this, I see comments such as - 'so what? culture changes all the time, deal with it'. Many, siminlar in vain. The question I ask is - why should we? If these countries believe they have certain cultural identities, social functions and beliefs and attitudes, why should they not fight to keep those going? I honestly doubt that such a blaise attitude would be shown if a group of Europeans entered into African/Asian spheres and began to dramatically change the culture and society - no one would dare say 'who cares' for fear of being labelled a racist, or an imperialist, or some long winded 'think-peice' articulating on the ongoing effects of colonialism in a post colonial word.\\n\\nThere's a very clear and open public opinion that mass immigration is beginning, or has already begun, to effect european culture in negative ways. I think people are certainly within their rights to want to have this issue adressed. I think there are certainly truths within these sentiments - I also think mass immigration has it's positives. But I don't think those positives are worth the negatives, and I feel that with controlled immigration (instead of a system we have now), many of those positives will continue to be felt.\\n\\nSo CMV, Change my view!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Quebec [used this](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bill-178/) to implement incredibly strong restrictions on speech in languages other than French.\\n\\nThe [*Oakes*](http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/OJEN_Oakes.pdf) test used by Canadian courts to determine if a violation of constitutional rights under Section 1 can be permitted is incredibly weak.\\n\\nUnder *Oakes* the government must show that \\n\\n1.

The impairment of rights has to be \"as little as is reasonably possible\" (and this one keeps creeping up, used to be \"minimal impairment.\")\\n\\n3. There must be proportionality between the infringement and the objective.\\n\\nIn contrast, in the US, a restriction on free speech like in the *Whatcott* case above would be subject to [strict scrutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny)  To meet the strict scrutiny standard the restriction must:\\n\\n1. Be justified by a compelling government interest.  The reason for the restriction has to be something the government *has* to do, not merely something they want to do.\\n\\n2. Be narrowly tailored to that interest.  That is, the restriction must be very specific to the exact thing the government must do.\\n\\n3. Be the least restrictive means possible to achieve the compelling government interest.  That means if there is any other way to accomplish the goal, it must be done before abridging the constitutional right in question.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of the US took on a case of much more hateful anti-gay speech than the *Whatcott* case right around the same time.  [That opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-751.pdf) sums up the US attitude to speech pretty well:\\n\\n&gt;Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and—as it did here—inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker.

Even if half the world died,  thats still 3.5 billion people left.  We're really not hurting in the food chain even with halving the population.

The label was meant to express the notion that I was willing to pursue circumstances that were beneficial to me. Living in a capitalistic society (I'm from the U.S.) I believe that it benefits me to be this way, and should not be interpreted as a negative quality.\\n\\nThe argument against being an opportunist is that you are not a loyalist. Now granted their are things that you would want to be loyal to and not take the opportunity that may exist. Say for example the ability to date a friends ex, or being able to exploit someone for your own benefit. However, overall I think if you want to be successful in a capitalistic society you have to be an opportunist.\\n\\nThe whole concept of capitalism reflects around the notion that opportunity exists and is there for the taking. Those who do take it are the ones that are going to be successful. To try to suggest that these people are immoral for such actions is an unfair qualifier in a system that teaches us to be this way. \\n\\nBeing an immigrant further solidifies my belief that being an opportunist is a good thing. My family pursued the opportunity that the U.S. afforded them and took advantage of coming here and building a better life for themselves. I see no reason why they should have a negative feeling about this opportunity that they have taken, and I think we should motivate more people to be opportunists. That way they too can pursue circumstances that will help better their lives.\\n\\nIn regards to the new rule: I am looking for a reason why being an opportunist is considered a bad thing. I don't want a circumstantial response. Meaning I don't want scenarios in which opportunity should not be seized, as I have already conceded that those situations exist.

I would count that as a \"cap on bottom\" design because the bottle can sit on its cap without concern of toppling.\\n\\nMy argument is very simple: cap on bottom designs are better, because as the remaining liquid gets to a low level, it remains by the spout and can easily be ejected. Otherwise, high-viscosity liquids require a lot of shaking and squeezing to eject from the bottle, as they have settled to the end furthest from the spout.\\n\\nI believe cap on top designs (defined here as designs where the bottle cannot rest on its cap without being at risk of falling over) are functionally inferior, with no functional advantages.

I feel like people should be allowed to walk around naked if the weather permits and they want to.  The primary arguments against it seem to be either religious modesty or \"we can\\'t let our children see that.\"\\n\\nAs a none religious person I base my morality off a simple question: Does this action harm another individual?  Sometimes if the answer could be yes, we can analyze the situation and determine that the person \"harmed\" is actually wrong (I.E. someone saying something silly offends them.)  I cannot see how someone being nude can harm another person.  If you don\\'t want to see it, then don\\'t look.  I understand an unattractive person not wanting their SO to see an attractive person naked, but the internet exists and their SO can see the hottest people on the planet naked with the click of a button.  Also, their SO is going to be thinking about that the next time you\\'re together, and their sex drive will be better as a result.  Furthermore, people become desensitized to nudity rather quickly.  If public nudity became mainstream, it wouldn\\'t take long for people to not even really think about it any more.  To me that makes that argument moot.\\n\\nChildren exposed to nudity is a much more controversial topic, and I think the line has to be drawn somewhere, but I think shielding them from any information is definitely not where the line should be drawn.  We obviously don\\'t want our children to grow up with a skewed view of sex (so obviously they shouldn\\'t watch some fetish porn or something) but does it really do some kind of damage to a child to see someone naked?  We are the only animal on the planet that covers up, and as far as I know, the only animal that won\\'t allow children of the species to view sexual acts.\\n\\nObviously I don\\'t want someone hurting my kids, or trying anything sexual with them, so having a guy in the bushes jerking off is definitely past where the line should be drawn, but I really see no harm whatsoever in my kids seeing people walk around in the natural form.  I don\\'t think it will cause any damage and I think it will actually be psychologically good for them, since they won\\'t be led to believe that something is wrong with their body so they have to cover it up.\\n\\nAm I seriously demented or is this a more common view than I\\'m aware?  Change my view?\\n\\nP.S.  Is it against the rules to comment on a post saying something like \"I agree with you, but here are the arguments that I\\'ve heard against your view,\" or are replies limited only to people who disagree?  The rules state not to make a post like that, but I\\'m not sure about a reply.\\n\\nEdit: I didn\\'t think about the sanitary effects of public nudity.  Perhaps some restrictions such as \"you cannot be in a situation where you would be in physical contact with another human or your genitals would be in contact with someone else\\'s property or public property.\"  That rule would allow someone to walk down the street, ride a bike, drive their car, swim, lay on the beach, sun tan in their front yard, etc. while prohibiting things like riding the public bus naked.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I believe that vegetarianism has never been conclusively shown to be detrimental to ones own health. Every necessary nutrient can be consumed in these diets. Pure veganism would be bad without B12 supplementation (and possibly creatine/iron/protein although not as much), but vegan B12 supplements exist. I don't think that vegetarianism/veganism is healthier than an omnivore diet, but rather that both are sustainable by humans.\\n\\nThis point is related to the evolution argument. I don't think that humans require a omnivorous diet. Humans probably evolved from a mostly frugivorous creature, but perhaps evolved to eat meat with a major deforestation event that caused their territory to become more savannah-like. I think they evolved to eat meat because of a lack of plant resources, and probably only ate meat on occasion. Canines are often brought up in relation to this point, but it is important to note that our canines are significantly reduced compared to our fruigvorous relatives (e.g. the orangutan) and that canine size in apes was probably a result of some process of sexual selection (evidenced in part by the vast sexual dimorphism).\\n\\nMoving on to the ethics, I think that killing many animals is wrong. I do draw a line, however, between different kinds of animals - a subtlety that I think is important albeit somewhat neglected. I think killing anything that can have emotion or conception of self is wrong. It is hard to say what animals can have these things, but it is reasonable to believe that many mammals can. I reject the idea that emotions or consciousness is only (or even most) realized in humankind.\\n\\nI do not think that killing anything without a brain is wrong. Therefore, I cannot care for jellyfish, sea urchins, or most mollusks, which all lack a CNS, and think that eating them is fine (even while they are still alive, as is sometimes done in parts of Japan with sea urchins-or uni). I generally think that eating insects is also fine, as their nervous system never completely centralized and I don't believe their supraesophageal ganglion is capable of understanding itself. The insect is clearly not capable of emotion or pain as we conceive of it, as it still attempts complex behavior (e.g. mating) even if its legs are chopped off.\\n\\nI start to have problems with chordates. I'm not sure what to think of fish, birds, and reptiles. Their brain is very similar to ours, and although their telencephala are very small, they have beginnings of a limbic system, and respond to pain in a broad sense, shutting down complex behavior and learning from it. I'm not sure whether their response is complex enough to be called pain (this is debatable for some of these creatures). Mammal brains are too complex for me to justify eating, especially those that we typically consume, such as cows and pigs (cows, for example, experience depression and commit suicide).\\n\\nTo summarize, my major argument is that consumption of many of the animals (esp. mammals) we typically consume is wrong. My secondary argument is that it would not be a bad idea to discontinue all meat consumption.\"},\n {'title': 'CMV: It is impossible to be single and happy (if you desire to ultimately be in a relationship)',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2pad6f',\n  'selftext': \"I think that, if you are someone who ultimately wants to be in a relationship, it is impossible to be single and happy.

Many people are also sensitive to caffeine and could use the labels to judge wether or not they want to drink that drink late in the day or when they need to sleep. Caffeine also is bad for people with certain heart conditions and will increase the likely hood a person will avoid that drink if they choose to consume less caffeine. Overall I think adding the content will help because it subliminaly shows people that caffeine is a drug and should be treated like it while increasing consumer awareness and choice while also not discouraging or inconvenienceing anyone who chooses to use caffeine.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'll go into my specific reasons below.\\n\\nSBRs: I have yet to see a valid reason for the heavy regulations in place for short barrel rifles. Currently, [this](https://i.imgur.com/kA6wkOI.jpg) is considered a pistol and can be bought at any gun store with just a background check. But [this](http://www.zahal.org/files/images/fab/New05.10/glockstock2copy.jpg) is considered an SBR and one must complete an onerous amount of paperwork to own one. This makes no sense and SBRs should be treated like any other firearm.\\n\\nSuppressors: Contrary to what video games tell you, suppressors don't make a firearm completely silent. In fact, they only reduce the noise level from around 180 to 120 dB. Their main purpose is to reduce hearing damage and noise pollution. In fact, many countries in Europe encourage if not require you to use one when hunting or shooting. Therefore, suppressors should not be a controlled item or only require a background check.\\n\\nMachine Guns: As it currently stands, machine guns produced after 1986 are illegal to own. The only thing this does is drive up prices to an absurd degree (A pre-ban machine gun will cost you around $20,000). This ban should be lifted to allow more people a chance to own one. Keep in mind that since 1934, only two murders have been committed with legally owned machine guns and one of those was by a police officer (who are exempt from this ban anyway).\\n \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But it's pretty easy to gauge things like that in a dog whose bloodline you don't know by just hanging out with them a little- terrier/shepherd looking dogs that are bouncing off the walls are probably going to be high energy. That doesn't require a pedigree to determine. Similarly, I can't think of a reason why a service dog would need to be 100% of a specific breed. Looking for a general type of dog makes sense, but why you would need a purebred lab and couldn't make do with a lab-x from a shelter is beyond me.

Not all of them, obviously, but not all purebred dogs are cut out to be police / service / drug dogs either.

I\\'m getting some aggressive PMs accusing me of being a trolling woman-bashing MRA guy who thinks men are always the victim of women. \\n\\nI don\\'t know how to change the details of this CMV to more clearly illustrate my point that, in American society, male victims of sexual assault receive less sympathy than women, at least partially because men are expected to be strong, dominant protectors, not victims. That\\'s NOT to say that women receive \"too much sympathy\", only that everyone deserves a support system and justice, and men are less likely to receive it in this instance for various cultural reasons. As a result, I think the fact that the United States government used rape as a war tactic is less shocking to the public because the victims were men, and not women. \\n_____\\n\\n\"Prisoners were subjected to \\'rectal feeding\\' without medical necessity.

If it was reported that a female detainee was sodomized with medical devices so frequently and so forcefully that she suffered a torn anus and her intestines were spilling out of her ass, I doubt Dick Cheney would proudly promise \"And I\\'d do it again!\" when asked about authorizing these tactics.\\n\\nDetainees were often kept naked, were beaten, waterboarded, chained and forced to stand in stress positions for up to a week at a time. And there are probably many more horrors that we will never know about. An interrogator and torturer at Abu Ghraib said of the Senate report\\'s details, \"I’m not surprised.

The image of a woman being subjected to sexual violence by government officials was convincing enough that many parroted these details as a reason why we need to \"liberate\" Iraq. The general consensus was that this sort of treatment is inhumane and would fall under the realm of \"crimes against humanity\".\\n\\nNow, there aren\\'t many high profile women working within terrorist groups, though they do exist. Would the same people who are comfortable with the treatment of male detainees be comfortable subjecting Samantha Lewthwaite, AKA the \"white widow\", to the same conditions to source information from her?\\n\\nWhat about other extremist groups? White supremacists/neo nazis, militant environmental groups, Chechen rebels, etc, etc. \\n\\nOf course, I\\'m completely opposed to any form of torture. Once it\\'s sanctioned for one purpose to save lives, why not another?  But even if it\\'s kept within the limited realm of the CIA, it seems this behavior is acceptable to commit against men, but would be labelled as a war crime if this was done to women.\\n\\nPerhaps it is because men are more commonly associated with terrorism. Perhaps it is because we view sexual violence against women to be somehow \"worse\" than it is for men. Regardless of the reasoning, the fact that sexual violence is an acceptable interrogation tool against men, but not for women, is incredibly sexist and wrong. \\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n {'title': 'CMV: People who back their car into parking spaces (so the front is facing out) waste their own time and the time of anyone trying to get around them.

I do recognize now that it is significantly safer to be able to pull out head first.  After reading some stats online, it seems that a fair amount of accidents are caused by people pulling out recklessly and being able to go out head first decreases those odds.

I\\'ve read things about body cams, and increased accountability all placing a taller order for officers. Most of it to me, comes off as basic cop hating, and doesn\\'t actually provide a reasonable solution that improves the amount of corrective justice taking place. In fact, it impedes the justice system because it introduces external hoops for police to jump over doing their job. My arguments are as follows:\\n\\nIncreasing police accountability increases police liability. In the era of social media, one bad experience can cost you your whole career. This is true for every job, BUT it\\'s exceptionally true for police who on a day to day basis subject themselves to this form of public scrutiny. I don\\'t see this going away under the current status quo, but I do think that adding more barriers to this particular issue destroys something the general populous values. Job stability. \\n\\n1.) Becoming a police officer like any other form of training is an investment, and the current state of affairs and the proposed state of affairs will diminish job stability for police officers. This results in a net negative in effective justice, because less officers means more crime. \\n\\n2.) It will create an upward trend in the risk/reward mentality. Due to their scarcity, cops will eventually lead to higher compensations to incentivize the fields. This is something present in other fields already where scarcity for the position exists, such as medical nurses having large signing bonuses. This leads to increased police spending for less officers, once again creating a net negative for justice.\\n\\n\\n3.) The proposed things I\\'ve heard (such as maiming instead of killing and body cams) provide proper closure for a negligible amount of cases, but create far more gaps in coverage than they are worth. So it\\'s logically inconsistent to say:\\n\\n \"Make cops more accountable, so we can have more true justice.\" \\n\\nRaising the liability of police officers, and destroying police coverage because of this ideology is not a positive boon to the justice system. Yes more high profile cases are covered better, but their frequency is too infrequent to justify the loss of police force. At which point if you insist on some of the measures suggested you are not for more justice, you are just cop hating.\\n\\nPlease CMV.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

False accusations of rape have been used as a tool to destroy the lives of others going all the way back to the Jim Crow South, where black men were hung on frivolous rape accusations.\\n\\nThis tradition continues today with cases like the University of Virginia and (this is what I believe, and not the subject of this post) Bill Cosby. \\n\\nA person making a legitimate accusation has nothing to fear, but people would think twice before wrongfully accusing others.\\n\\nI have predicted the generic responses to my argument and will respond to them here.\\n\\n**Rightful accusers would have something to fear, if the person who victimized them gets away with their crime, they will now face prosection**\\n\\nThis is a good point, but I think that this can be solved by rethinking the way we choose juries. Jury selection in this country is effectively a rigged process, regardless of the location of the trial, the makeup of juries is almost always a homogeneous group of white suburbanites with predictable opinions. This makes it very difficult to convict criminal archetypes like the college rapist, or the malpracticing doctor. By introducing higher racial and socioeconomic diversity into juries, we can eliminate the predictability of verdicts.\\n\\n**The punishment is harsher than the crime.**\\n\\nNo it isn't. Killing someone is no different than setting a machine in motion that will result in them dying. Tricking the government into locking someone away for 40 years is surely a capital offense, and should be punished as such.\\n\\n**The perjury charge handles this**\\n\\nI believe that this is too weak, it is not a capital offense, and it should be.\\n\\nI am willing to change this view, but it will take some level of convincing. I am eager to hear the responses.  \\n\\nMODIFICATION OF MY VIEW credit to /u/AMereRedditor:\\n\\nI now believe that the minimum sentence for the crime that the accuser was accused of is inappropriate, but that the maximum sentence for the attempted version of the same crime is still very much appropriate. (If you are found guilty of knowingly, wrongfully accusing someone of murder, your sentence should be the maximum for attempted murder)\\n \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Sports in the summer Olympics take more athletic ability.\\nNow, I wont pretend that some sports in the winter Olympics don't take excessive amounts of athletic ability, but there's a large abundance of stuff that takes next to no real athletic ability. Curling and luge come to mind right off the bat as some of the grossest offenders. \\n\\n2. Most of the sports in the winter Olympics aren't even an option for most people around the world. \\nUnless you live in one of the countries that's pretty much only mountains, you don't ever even have the option to be good at any of these sports. Name one time in your life you ever had the option to go to your local speed skating rink. I would wager that less than 1/100 of us on Reddit ever had the option to partake in something like that, as opposed to the summer Olympics, which is made up of mostly sports that everyone has heard of or played at some point. Even as someone who grew up in America where there are a good amount of mountains, my family would have had to have been rich for me to even get into a sport like snowboarding where I would have to be on the mountain non-stop. The fact that the number of people that ever even get to try these sports is way lower, makes the sports being played less interesting, because the level of competition can't be the same. \\n\\n3. Summer Olympic sports are more popular in general.\\nThe sports in the winter Olympics are just plain old boring. The summer Olympics are made up mostly of sports that have stood the test of time and people have loved for a long time. The winter Olympics are full of sports that people only watch because it's their country against the others. Most people couldn't tell you any of the techniques to bobsledding or how to score a snowboarding run. They also have no idea how impressive or difficult the tasks in the winter Olympics are because again, nobody has ever even had the chance to try this stuff out before. \\n\\nThese are probably the biggest reasons IMO that the Summer Olympics kick the shit out of the winter Olympics.

If the statute of limitations for rape has already passed, then Cosby can't be charged with rape.\\n\\n∆\\nI began this saying I was unaware of the specifics of the whole affair because I don't keep up with celebrity gossip. From all the attention it has garnered I was unaware that there was not a criminal case in progress, nor that the accusations are so old and past the statutes of limitation. That makes this much different because she's no longer someone trying to get double jeopardy with a civil case following a criminal case, but rather someone in the middle of media barrage. I still feel that should she have done this in the context of a criminal case it would have been wrong, but clearly the context of this case is much different than what I had been lead to believe.\\n_____\\n*As a preface, I'm not someone who usually cares much about celebrity or their scandals. For all I care, they're just more fallible people doing what they will. I've been vaguely aware of the controversy as a bunch of women are accusing Bill Cosby of rape under dubious circumstances, I think anyone who spends any significant amount of time would have to have at least heard of it, but I do not know the specific details. This is not a case for Cosby's guilt or innocence, I really could not care less about it, this is about the newest suit.*\\n_____\\nI overheard this being discussed briefly on the radio this morning, and the implications of Cosby's latest lawsuit are deeply disturbing to me. I went and found an [article about it](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/bill-cosby-faces-defamation-lawsuit-755791?utm_source=twitter) but for those who don't know, apparently the latest in the Bill Cosby rape scandal is a lawsuit for defamation of character. Basically, one of the women who has accused him of sexual assault is now trying to sue him for discrediting her accusations; for calling her a liar. \\n\\nTo me, this is a very dangerous case. I do not know the details regarding Cosby's guilt and I do not care to make a debate for or against him, this is a moot point. However, the implications of the lawsuit being pressed against him scare me. If someone accuses a person of something as serious as rape, that person's life is now turned upside. Regardless of guilt or innocence, their public image will be destroyed because their name will now be forever associated with sex crime. That this person can then be sued for defending themselves seems to be an abuse of the law.\\n\\nAs a man, it feels like there's no winning. There's a lot of radical feminist culture online which seems to suggest this idea that there is a pervasive rape culture and universal hatred towards women; a culture which paints the male image as a potential rapist waiting to strike. If this woman is successful in her defamation suit, it feels like no matter what men would be hopeless. If you're accused of rape, regardless of the facts you're guilty. If you try to defend your image or discredit the accuser's claims, you're guilty. Lose-Lose. \\n\\nWhat part of this is alright?

I feel that climate change is a natural, cyclical phenomenon that humans are simply exaggerating. What I\\'m skeptical about is the extent to which the problem is human vs. the extent to which it is natural.\\n\\nI\\'d like to begin by pointing out that climate change is obviously a cyclical, natural phenomenon as observed through ice ages, interglacial periods, and greenhouse ages, an extremely long-term cycle. Imagine climate change like a [sine curve](https://google.com/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;q=sine+curve&amp;oq=sine+curve&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.1132.3986.0.4134.16.10.2.3.3.0.160.1009.7j3.10.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.60.img..1.15.1027.fgfdh2HHjbU#imgdii=_). Yes, I know it wouldn\\'t actually resemble a perfect curve, but I\\'m generalizing for the purpose of visualization. It is conclusively proven that [surface temperature and ocean temperature has risen](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/) over the last few decades. But is this really *caused* by humans like we are told? Scientific records of surface temperature patterns don\\'t go far enough back to determine if there is or isn\\'t a similar rise/fall over a longer term. Scientists are assuming temperatures were always lower than current, and humans are just now making them rise. How do we know that before 1880 (earliest date in the linked observations) temperatures weren\\'t falling from levels similar to those we experience now? How do we know that this problem takes place in a matter of two or three decades and not a century or two? Perhaps right now, the rising temperatures are simply the result of us living in and observing the naturally occurring rise in the \"sine curve.\" \\n\\nTwo other pieces of evidence for the natural-phenomenon theory would be our polar ice caps. We were told that the Northern ice cap would be \"ice free\" by 2013. We were also told in 2013 by the [2013 IPCC Climate Report](http://un.org/climatechange/the-science/) that \"It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin...as global mean surface temperature rises.\" Yes, it hit its lowest extent in 2012, but [it has grown larger since then](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2738653/Stunning-satellite-images-summer-ice-cap-thicker-covers-1-7million-square-kilometres-MORE-2-years-ago-despite-Al-Gore-s-prediction-ICE-FREE-now.html). The antarctic also reached [a record all-time high](http://nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum/#.VIi0zzHF9Wg) in sea-ice levels. These two polar ice growths are indicative of A) A natural phenomenon that fluxuates, or B) Earth\\'s natural adaptation and attempt at homeostasis. We have no accurate measurements of arctic and antarctic ice levels from pre 1800\\'s Earth, and thus cannot observe the possibility that *this may have happened before* and it\\'s simply happening again. We, with our new technology of the 20th and 21st Centuries, have stumbled upon what could be a naturally occurring cycle and have quickly labeled it as a global crisis without adequate *long* term observations and evidence. Scientists will not consider the possibility that *this might not be our fault.*\\n\\nIn addition, I am also skeptical of the extent to which humans are exaggerating this phenomenon. Speaking from personal observation of my area and observation of the weather across the United States, I have observed no climate patterns that could in any way be considered life-threatening or Earth-altering. In 2013, I noticed it was approximately 70 F until mid November, and then in 2014 it was around 40 F in early October. But this and the autumn snowfall in the Northeast this October are the only \"unusual\" climate patterns I\\'ve seen, and they are simply *nothing more than an inconvenience.* No sort of humanity-threatening climate patterns have occurred, and no sort of ecosystem-altering weather has stricken the North American area (I am stating this understanding the fact that my area of observation is limited. I am completely open to any sort of unusual climate patterns in any areas redditors may be present). I have seen no compelling evidence whatsoever that climate change, outside of an extremely long-term scale, will pose anything more than an inconvenience. Having to break out your winter clothes in October, or keeping your shorts and tank tops on until November doesn\\'t threaten life as the entirety of Earth knows it. \\n\\nIt may be annoying, but climate change poses no *threat* to life on Earth, and it is most likely a naturally occurring phenomenon that we have quickly misjudged to be entirely our fault.\\n\\nEdit: Paragraph spacing\\n\\nNote: Any responses providing major points and/or refutations would be 100x more helpful with a reliable source or two\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any R/O\\'s that exists today must be the result of a web of artificial and restorative R/O\\'s that stretch back to natural R/O\\'s.\\n\\nIndependent of human action is the collection of natural R/O\\'s. Under such conditions, like today, there are two ways to create new R/O\\'s 1) You can violate existing R/O\\'s. Today if you stole something you may be obligated to return it or otherwise make the victim whole. Similarly, under conditions of natural R/O\\'s violations of R/O\\'s may create new restorative R/O\\'s. 2) Certain actions that conform to R/O\\'s may result in new R/O\\'s. Like a new law may create new R/O\\'s\\n\\nFrom the state of natural R/O\\'s, there may be new R/O\\'s. And then the synthesis of the new and natural R/O\\'s will create a state of R/O\\'s from which yet still more R/O\\'s.\\n\\nTo put this into practice, some claim that the right to keep and bare arms predates government and is a natural right. This model has nothing further to say about that. \\n\\nSome claim they have a right to an education and base this on the social contract. If the social contract does create new R/O\\'s it will have roots in R/O\\'s that exist independent of human action. In this model there is a simple solution for this, simply call education a natural right, or call the social contract a natural right. \\n\\nBut social contract theory assumes a government and then proceeds to explain why that government may create new R/O\\'s. This model cannot validate the social contract until government can be shown to be a consequence of actions rooted in pre-existing R/O\\'s.\\n\\nThis is a correct model for evaluating rights and obligations. CMV.\\n\\nEdit:\\nI\\'m thinking \\'original rights and obligations\\' would have been a better phrase to use rather than getting tied up with the history of natural rights. \\n\\nTLDR:\\n\\nA defense of rights or obligations based on human action, ie laws, wars, declarations, etc, must reach back to actions that create rights and obligations under conditions of the original rights or obligations. \\n\\n\"You are obligated to pay my student debt.\"  \\n\"Why does that obligation exist?\"  \\n\"Because POTUS said so.\"  \\n\"Why does he get to create obligations?\"  \\n\"Because elections.\"  \\n\"Why do elections create obligations?\"  \\n.....  \\n\"Because social contract.\"  \\n\"Why does social contract create obligations?\"  \\n.....  \\n\"Because two guys made an agreement.\"  \\n\"Why does an agreement create obligations?\"  \\n\"Because two guys making an agreement can make obligations under conditions of the original rights and obligations.\"  \\n\"Oh.

My view:\\n\\n--The cops had a job to do. They had to arrest Garner. They had probable cause. To arrest him, they had to restrain him. Garner had been arrested 30 times before. He knows the routine. He was going to get cuffed, one way or another. If you know the police want to cuff you, and you aggressively resist the officers have no choice but to restrain you, somehow.\\n\\n--I don\\'t see a chokehold in the video. I see a headlock. When several cops are restraining a very big, angry, aggressive guy, a headlock is absolutely necessary. If you don\\'t restrain the head during the takedown, you\\'re endangering your fellow officers.\\n\\n--If it were a chokehold, Garner would have lost consciousness and gone limp within a few seconds. That doesn\\'t happen.\\n\\n--If it were a chokehold, one forearm would have been clamped hard across Garner\\'s throat. The cop\\'s other hand would have been pushing Garner\\'s head down toward his chest. That cuts off blood supply to the brain, which is why it causes unconsciousness so quickly.\\n\\n--Some commentators have said that the cop cruelly pushes Garner\\'s head into the sidewalk. I\\'m not sure it is cruel, but I can see the officer pushing Garner\\'s head down until they get the cuffs on him. As soon as the cuffs are on, the cop releases the head. I was a high school wrestler. One of the first things a wrestler learns is that if you control the head, you control the rest of the body. The officer is merely doing his job, restraining and controlling Garner until the other officers get the cuffs on.\\n\\n--In years past, the officers would have whacked Garner with their clubs, shot him with a taser, or maced him. Because these methods sometimes cause deaths or injuries and are sometimes regarded as cruel, the officers preferred to restrain him physically, which might be less harmful to the suspect, if multiple officers cooperate in the takedown.\\n\\n--It\\'s true that Garner was unarmed. He wasn\\'t a threat to the lives of the officers. In this situation, however, officers are very concerned about the risk twisted knees, low back injuries, and that sort of thing. With a very large, aggressive suspect, this is a serious concern. Injuries like that end police careers all the time, because police officers often have to restrain combative suspects like Garner.\\n\\n--Garner is saying or yelling, \"I can\\'t breathe!\" The police union has pointed out, correctly, that if you can talk or shout, you are, in fact breathing. It\\'s not quite clear why he is yelling, \"I can\\'t breathe.\" He continues to say it after the headlock is released, after he is cuffed, and after the cops roll him on his side.\\n\\n--It is dangerous for a big, heavy man to be cuffed and left face-down. The officers know that and properly roll him on his side. He continues to say, \"I can\\'t breathe,\" possibly because he is having an asthma attack. The officers properly called for an ambulance right away. Police officers don\\'t know how to diagnose and treat asthma, and Garner has been so aggressive and resistive that removing Garner\\'s cuffs would endanger the officers.\\n\\n--Garner died of a cardiac arrest in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. A bad asthma attack can cause a cardiac arrest.\\n\\n--The coroner\\'s report states that Garner\\'s windpipe was not injured and his hyoid bone was not broken. (The hyoid bone is usually broken when people are strangled to death.)\\n\\n--It is not clear why Garner suffered a cardiac arrest in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. However, he was grossly obese, a heavy smoker, he had evidence of heart disease, and he had asthma. The coroner\\'s report notes all of these contributing factors. A vigorous struggle with several officers might have been enough to trigger a cardiac arrest. Running up a few flights of stairs could have had exactly the same effect on Garner.\\n\\n--The coroner\\'s report states that homicide was the cause of death. This can be misunderstood. Homicide only means that the actions of one person caused another person to die. If a dangerous intruder breaks into my home and I shoot him in self defense, I have also committed \"homicide.\" Homicide is often misunderstood as \"murder,\" but it isn\\'t.\\n\\n--The coroner\\'s report is somewhat ambiguous and I have not seen an adequate explanation of it. The coroner says death was caused by \"compression of the neck,\" yet the windpipe was undamaged, the hyoid bone was not broken, and Garner remained conscious until some time after he entered the ambulance.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So I am a firm believer in cultural relativism, that you can not judge a culture base off of morals or societal norms you gained from your own culture. So we have example one, that being gay is okay because we have seen it throughout history in many different cultures, the Greeks being a prime example. However they also were constant offenders of pedophilia, forcing twelve year old boys to give oral sex to grown men. We bring up pacific island cultures, that idolize drag queens and transgenders, however there are also cultures where the women teach the 9 year old boys how to have sex. How can the first be okay but not the second. They are both acceptable in their respective cultures just one is deemed disgusting in our culture. We bring up animals, point out how so many different species have gay relationships, but animals also start having sex as soon as they are able to produce babies, which is like twelve for us. Being gay is natural, being a pedophile is natural, we see both through out history and across species lines. Neither are the \"norm\" but are widely accepted in many cultures. However, westernized cultures have deemed sex with children to be wrong. I ask a westerner what they think about pedophilia they say its disgusting. Its the same when I ask a homophobic Christians what they think about gay people, they say it\\'s disgusting. Both are view points that have been instilled in those people through their culture. Since it is widely accepted that pedophilia is bad, I feel like the gay community gets defensive and tries to distant themselves for pedophilia, when in truth they are very much alike. \\n\\nBefore I get all the messages of being homophobic or being a child molester, I figured I\\'d state my views. I am in full support of the gay community, I have a gay sister that I love very dearly. I am in noway condoning or promoting pedophilia I too find it disgusting and wrong but understand that that viewpoint is a product of the society I grew up in.  \\n\\nEdit: view has been changed, giving credit to /u/terribleusername. He argued with the idea of cultural relativism in mind. Not blindly calling pedophilia rape because kids cannot give consent. As I argued with many of you the consent line we draw is arbitrary. Others seemed to just be arguing on the premise that being a pedophile is bad, when my view was that it is related to being gay regardless of right and wrong. Everything seemed to opinion based. Like it causes harm, which I understand is by our standards wrong, but is still an opinion. Whats the correct age of consent, all still opinion and too loosely defined for my liking, to actually change my view. However /u/terribleusername pointed out that the difference would be that every culture has a cultural line for it. The fact that every culture must make a different line for the age of consent makes it a bit different from homosexuality. I know I argued consent with a lot of people, but the point is that we or even culture have to question consent, it makes it a little different from being gay. Although I still find them related, not nearly as closely than when I first began.                  \\n\\nP.S. apologize for the hurt feeling, I understand I could have worded the title a little bit better.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Even so, a journalist in the episode argues that it is unethical to publically accuse the man in front of a television audience, without any conviction or trial.\\n\\nThis seems to have aroused a huge backlash, with articles published [on Jezebel](http://jezebel.com/a-terrible-episode-with-worse-timing-the-newsroom-tack-1668181204) and elsewhere accusing Aaron Sorkin of choosing to \"victim-blame a woman who was raped\"—despite the fact, that, as Sorkin points out in a later quotation in the article, he *created* this character to be a sympathetic *alleged* rape victim whose story has been neither corroborated nor disproved.\\n\\nAnother quotation from the NYT article:\\n\\n&gt;Emily Nussbaum, the TV critic for The New Yorker, wrote of the producer character: “**He argues that the idealistic thing to do is not to believe her story.**”\\n\\n___\\n##Presentation of my views\\n\\nIt seems to me that in discussions of this sort, people persistently conflate \"not believing one\\'s story\" with \"disbelieving one\\'s story\", as if there were no option other than believing in one thing or the opposite—but this distorts the basic fact that in a world where perfect truth is unattainable, NOT believing in something is distinct from DISbelieving it. When two people dispute something, and I don\\'t have a good reason to believe one or the other, my default position is not to presumptively believe either until the introduction of further evidence. This is a commonplace in most areas of human life, but when the subject in dispute is whether A raped B it seems less and less to be taken for granted.\\n\\nMoreover, I believe that it is extremely difficult to come up with credible statistics about how likely uncorroborated accusations are to be true for the simple reason that one is inherently dealing with disputed, uncorroborated things, and is very liable to fall into circular reasoning or a similar lapse in rendering the all important question of how to categorize a given accusation for purposes of his study. For this reason, I mentally have grave reservations every time I read a number purporting to say what percentage of rape accusations are true or false.\\n\\nFurthermore, even if, for argument\\'s sake, one granted that the vast majority of rape accusations were true, I still believe that due process as we think of it with regard to criminal accusations of any sort—*viz.*, \"innocent until proven guilty\"—would remain vitally important, because its abrogation in *any* case would warp the incentive structures embedded in our society. It would be a very dangerous thing to create a system that provides an avenue for a false accuser to disastrously affect someone else\\'s life, while facing little or no potential negative impact him- or herself.\\n___\\n##Summary of my views\\n\\nThe views I\\'m asking you to change, if you can, are:\\n\\n1. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know with any accuracy what percentage of rape accusations are true or false. Therefore, assumptions of this nature should be given very limited credibility in the broader discussion of how to deal with a rape accusation.\\n\\n2. The protocol of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is important NOT as a method of determining actual truth (how could it be?) but as a way to avoid creating societal systems that can be manipulated and abused by false accusers. As such, it should be adhered to whenever departing from it would create a loophole for such abuse.\\n\\n3. A common and misleading rhetorical tactic frequently used by advocates of strengthening laws and other societal devices intended to discourage and/or punish rape is to frame the issue as if the only two possibilities are for us to presumptively believe one side or the other. This ignores the third, most important possibility of all, which is not to take a presumptive position in the absence of corroborating evidence. The false assumption that one must begin by taking a presumptive position distorts the practical issues at hand to the point of making reasonable discussion on them impossible while that assumption remains unchallenged.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n##My biases\\n\\nI should mention for the record that I have a tendency to think about things in the abstract rather than relating to them strongly on an emotional level (an INTP personality type, if you like [the Myers-Briggs categorization system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator)). Furthermore, I\\'m a man and do not personally know any rape victims that I\\'m aware of, so to the extent that I do relate to these things on an emotional level (which of course I do, too) I feel more strongly the plight of the hypothetical innocent man facing a false accusation (the position I can more readily imagine myself in) than the hypothetical violated woman seeking justice.\\n\\nI\\'m aware of both these biases, and of course, like everything else in our world of matter and men, my views are also subject to Newton\\'s First Law, which states that to alter them requires a force equivalent to that with which they were previously held.\\n\\n___\\n\\n##And so...\\nwith those caveats in mind, change my views please, if you will: any or all of them. Even if you don\\'t succeed in changing them entirely, I\\'ll welcome any added perspective you can provide me, and I believe I\\'m open to that much at the very least.\\n\\n____\\n\\n##PS: Support roles\\n\\nA number of people in this thread have drawn a distinction between the roles of (ideally) neutral public figures like law officers and journalists and the roles of a person\\'s support system (immediate family and close friends), suggesting that public stances in cases like this should be neutral, but private stances should be unreservedly supportive. I\\'d tentatively agree with that, with the proviso that I\\'d apply it equally to close friends of either potential victim (of rape or of slander). I\\'d add that I feel people should be generally freer to rely on their individual judgment in deciding what to believe when they\\'re not acting on those beliefs in a way that\\'s liable to directly cause harm to someone else.\\n\\n____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The issues being brought up surrounding the GamerGate controversy were mostly either about gender in the videogame industry or the ethical concerns of game journalism.  I feel that writing off anyone\\'s position by calling them a SJW skews our ideas of what social justice really is, which is holding us back from making social progress. \\n\\nIn my eyes, valid points were raised on both sides of the GamerGate discussion.

Often I see the term being used to describe anyone who talks about any social issue, whether the poster has an understanding of the topic or not. The people throwing out the SJW accusations seem to use this as a defense to keep things the way they are and not have to engage in conversation about racial, gender, or identity issues in any meaningful way.

I do believe that the majority of people are, in fact, corrupt. So assuming you take a random person and insert them into a position of power, it is likely that they will abuse the power that is granted to them. But, I also believe if you take a person who isn\\'t corrupt, and insert them into this same position of power, they will not abuse the privileges and power of the position that is granted to them.\\n\\nI think teachers illustrate this point very well, especially because it is much easier to become a teacher than say, the President of the United States. In this regard, you tend to have a larger sample size and have many more types of people to consider. In most cases, I would say that teachers tend to have absolute power over their classes, at least with regards to day-to-day activities. (Generally, if a teacher says to do something, it is expected that the student comply to the demand of the teacher. If the student disagrees, typically the matter is resolved at a later date with the intervention of a teacher\\'s superior.)\\n\\nTaking this assumption that teachers have absolute power over their students, you still tend to find a balance of teachers who abuse their power, and those who don\\'t. If the saying that \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" were true, all teachers would abuse their power, since it is the power that corrupts the person, and not the person that corrupts the power.\\n\\nParents work well for this example as well. Literally anybody can become a parent, as having a child is as easy as having sex. I would even say that parents definitely have absolute power over their children, even moreso than teachers. But even with parenting, you still tend to find a balance. Some parents are incredibly strict and unfair, dictating arbitrary rules for their children that they themselves may not follow, or rules that have no legitimate reason other than \"because I say so.\" (I\\'m not arguing the fact that sometimes parents use the \"because I say so\" justification even if the rule does have a legitimate reason, but sometimes parents don\\'t actually have a reason other than \"I say so.\") However, you also find parents that are incredibly fair with their children. If a child does not agree with a rule set by a parent, and argues his or her case fairly, there are parents that would reconsider and change their rule for the sake of being fair. If \"absolute power corrupts absolutely,\" parents like the latter would not exist, as the power they hold over their child would corrupt them.\\n\\nTL;DR: CMV: Absolute power does not corrupt absolutely; absolute corruption corrupts power absolutely.'},\n {'title': 'CMV: With the emergence of the Internet, self-learning is much more superior than traditional school.',\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2ook4i',\n  'selftext': \"I'm basing this on my experience solely.

Every word written on paper, every thought ever thought by every human ever, every cell phone number and debit card pin number, the answers to all mathematical questions and equations, the purpose of the universe and God himself, every social theory and it's implications in the real world, what happens in the future and how every single event perpetuated by every single person from the past made the future come to be.  \\n\\nThis is physically impossible for any being.  Just the idea of God knowing everyone's thoughts alone is an impossible idea.  Neurons in the brain are not accessible through another brain's neurons, there's no network there.  You can't access an ordinary USB drive without plugging it in.  You can't access someone's brain without complicated machinery.  Then there's the fact that there are 7 billion humans going in and out of building's and tunnels and going underground.  God would need some kind of physical contact for each human being in order to do this and would need to be able to follow them through high-security checkpoints in some cases.  They tend to keep wildlife out pretty well.  They'd notice God coming in and reading our minds.\\n\\nAll-present:  Again, people are everywhere and going everywhere, from the deepest mine shaft to the highest sattelite, humanity is everywhere now and God would need be critically aware of each of the 7 billion people's situations in order to craft his constant judgement.  Humanity has a hard time multi-tasking with petting its head, rubbing its tummy, and jumping up and down on one leg.\\n\\nAll-Powerful:  Nothing is immortal.  Supposedly, God has been here (or everywhere, rather) for billions of years.  The only immortal animal is, what, a lobster?  I suppose that's a good case for immortailty, but the lobster lacks in all other God's qualities, so that can't work.  There are tortoises and trees that live for hundreds of years, but God would have had to have lived for BILLIONS.  Humans start to decay after about 30, right?  If we don't take good care of ourselves, we're dead by about 80.  With all the intense work God would be doing watching over the world, God wouldn't be able to take care of himself.

Their reasons are often objectionable, and I do not see why we continue to use this party system. I do understand that it would be an absolutely HUGE undertaking to redo this system and I am not advocating for an immediate change. \\n\\nFor example: net neutrality. What the hell is going on here? From what I understand, we have ISP corporations paying government officials to pass laws or the such to benefit the ISP. (That, of which, is an entirely different discussion) So now we effectively have the ISPs vs the ones who didn\\'t accept the money. What on earth? We didn\\'t elect the ISPs. We elected representatives... People who are supposed to stand for the general public, not a couple corporations. Additionally - we all know Obama is pro neutrality. I have no opinion on Obama or his work. Maybe I will after he finishes this term. But I see people opposing net neutrality SOLELY because Obama is for it. What? You\\'re willing to limit one of the greatest inventions for technological growth in the last century just because the other party doesn\\'t want to limit it? You have no basis to your argument, its just that Obama is for it. And apparently he is never morally right ? How can voters trust your party if you just go against another persons beliefs just because of who they are? \\n\\nIf this whole ordeal repeatedly continues into other issues that we face in the future, what does this mean for the citizens? It would effectively be run by whoever has more people in power, and those people have a chance of being run by money sent to them by corporations. \\n\\nAdditionally, I often see that we are left with the choice of \"dumb vs dumber\" in elections.

The already somewhat isolated Maritime provinces of Canada would become even more isolated and would gravitate towards the New England states. With New England closer in line to Canada in terms of norms and mores, the temptation to build a new union of the Maritimes/New England plus eastern New York might grow especially if the US leaned further right.\\n\\nIf such a thing happened, I think that the dominoes would fall in which both the US and Canada as we know them splinter off. Greater New York becomes Singapore on steroids. Most of the former Confederacy reforms. Texas and Florida go at it alone, the latter attempting to conquer Cuba and perhaps get The Bahamas on their side too.

Working almost anywhere means you are working for someone else. Your salary is considered what you earned despite the fact that you may have been instrumental in generating exponentially more money than you took home for someone else. Your hard work is going into someone else\\'s pocket and they\\'re shaving off a few scraps so you\\'ll show up tomorrow.\\n\\nSo, to summarize; work is you showing up somewhere to spend the majority of your waking day doing something you probably don\\'t like and doesn\\'t make you happy to fill someone else\\'s pockets.

By contrast, in India, people often live with their parents even after getting married. I think it\\'s similar in other Asian cultures but I can only really speak for India. A better way to summarize it is that the American \"nuclear family in the house\" model is inferior to the Indian \"extended family in the house\" model.  \\n\\nOne reason is the convenience factor. If you work in the same general area as where your parents live (i.e. in the Bay Area or in LA), it just makes sense for you to live with them. You can save money on rent/mortgage and utilities. You can share rides. You can live in a place that you\\'re already intimately familiar with.  \\n\\nThen there\\'s the emotional aspect. Who knows you better and loves you more than your parents? No one, that\\'s who. Sure, friends and lovers are good for fun and pleasure, but when it comes to people who genuinely love you and care for you, no one can beat your parents (or, for that matter, extended family like grandparents and relatives). Your parents also need you to take care of them when they\\'re older, and that\\'s just not possible if you live somewhere else. In the American/western system, aging parents are often thrown into a retirement/nursing home and abandoned there.

What I do think, however, is that people in favor more gun control spend far more effort on it than they should, if saving lives, reducing injuries, or reducing societal costs are the goal. \\n\\nTobacco and alcohol should be far more hated than guns are. Let me explain:\\n\\n&gt; Yet every year tobacco kills more Americans than did World War II — more than AIDS, cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vehicular accidents, homicide and suicide combined.\\n\\n[Source.](http://www.lung.org/associations/states/colorado/tobacco/) That's a total of 443,000 people. 88,000 of those deaths are from secondhand smoke, which is very disgusting to me because many of those victims had no ability to prevent being near it.\\n\\nGuns account for 32,000 deaths per year -of which 11,000 are homicides- and 71,000 injuries [source.](http://www.bradycampaign.org/sites/default/files/GunDeathandInjuryStatSheet3YearAverageFINAL.pdf) \\n\\nAlcohol causes [88,000 deaths per year]( http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm), of which over [10,300](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html) were killed from DUI's. Of those,  [1,168 were children.](http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/impaired-drv_factsheet.html)\\n\\nOn top of this, while seems to me that neither alcohol nor tobacco has any significant benefits, at least guns can be used for defense, and when guns are used properly they are safe; but it is literally impossible to smoke or drink without doing damage to the body.\\n\\nI know guns cause needless deaths and injuries, but smoking isn't pursued politically like guns are. Not only that, but grabbing a smoke isn't reacted to as negatively as having a gun is in society, even though second hand smoke alone is more likely to kill you. Nobody gets scared at the cigarettes or beers sold at gas stations, yet most are uncomfortable at the presence of a gun.  \\n\\nThe point isn't that we shouldn't do reasonable gun control measures or that gun violence isn't a problem, but that the energy and drive put into banning assault weapons after Sandy Hook was more effort than has recently been put into banning tobacco. \\n\\nOutside of guns being intrinsically scary, why is it relatively targeted so much both politically and in society? I know my post makes it sound like I'm just plugging my own opinion, but I'm genuinely asking to see what I'm missing.\\n\\nEdit: I have seen a few people say that more gun control is the next thing on society's menu, but that doesn't make mathematically sense if saving lives is the point. Some have implied that the deaths of smokers and drinkers isn't what's important, but rather the deaths of those who never chose to do the dangerous things. But, because of how many people die from secondhand smoke relative to guns that point also doesn't make sense. Some say that tobacco is already regulated so society is moving on to guns, but guns are even more regulated (backgound checks, and to carry in public a safety course is required. No such course that explains the dangers is required to buy cigarettes). It seems to be that the *kind* of death is what matters, where a bullet is more sudden and dramatic than cancer.

I think this is problematic for a few reasons.\\n\\nFirst, it is linguistically incorrect.\\n\\nPrivilege implies an intentionally granted advantage - such as the privilege to live in a certain area, or use certain facilities, and so on. There are privileges like this that certain groups have - for example, straights have the privilege of marriage.\\n\\nBut, not all advantages fit into this category. For example, one of the greatest advantages a white person has over a black person is that the white person is far less likely to be murdered by a law enforcement official. This is not a privilege, since it is not something intentionally granted, but it is still used under that umbrella term.\\n\\nSecond, it is an abrasive term.\\n\\nPeople hear a phrasing like \"white privilege\", and bristle at it, because they do not necessarily feel that they have had privileged lives. On an individual level, the advantages of belonging to any one group tends to get washed out by individual variation and the fact that there are so many characteristics, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, that one is able to vary in.\\n\\nOn the other hand, people tend to recognize easily that they have had some advantages, and do not bristle nearly so strongly against a statement like that. A word like \"advantage\" is then more appropriate to having a discussion on the topic, because it is less likely to cause a person to immediately assume the defensive.\\n\\nThird, it seems to imply a one-way street.\\n\\nThe word \"privilege\" seems to imply a unilateral advantage, whereas \"advantage\" can handle more nuance. To put it another way, it is more flowing to say a sentence like \"Men and women have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other\" than to say \"men and women are both privileged over each other\". And, it is certainly the case that, while lopsided, there are advantages that go both ways for many of these sorts of groupings.\\n\\nFor instance, straight couples have the advantage of, say, being able to have children together without medical assistance (excluding fertility issues), over gay couples, while gay couples have the advantage of not needing to worry about the possibility of an accidental pregnancy.\\n\\nYes, I have heard inherent (rather than social) characteristics like that included in the overall term \"privilege\", but if you don\\'t think they are appropriate, another example: from an early age, males are taught that \"you don\\'t hit a girl\", while girls are given no such instruction against violence, and indeed, violence committed by women on men is treated as more of a joke, or dismissed (\"you got beaten up by a GIRL?\"). I trust I don\\'t need to provide an example of the opposite - I don\\'t think I\\'ve met anyone who rejects the inverse premise, but on request, I will do so.\\n\\nSo, with all this considered, \"privilege\" is a narrow word used to incorrectly describe a larger set of issues which can more accurately be labelled and understood with the words \"advantage\" and \"disadvantage\", and furthermore is unnecessarily abrasive, such that its use also impedes constructive discourse.\\n\\nChange my view.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I do not necessarily think there is a *responsibility* for C to do so, though. However, this is not central to my belief, or to this post.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

She will defend their talent and originality to the end of the earth.\\n\\nThis was in response to me expressing my opinion that pop music as a whole is not all the same and unoriginal, but certain groups certainly are. Taylor Swift is one. I don't particularly enjoy her songs, and have only just felt that she writes unique music in light of Blank Space. Even so, it's catchy, but not necessarily original with pretty superficial lyrics. One Direction I feel is not at all original! All they've ever written are simple chord songs, again, with very superficial lyrics. I'm sure there are more artists out there that I can point to (Demi Lovato? Selena Gomez? Maroon 5? I dunno, I don't actively listen for them).\\n\\nTo summarize, I think the characteristics I think make these groups unoriginal are the type of fans they attract (if your music isn't meaningful, it's not going to attract people who look for meaning and quality!), simple song structure, superficial lyrics, and an overall effort to be catchy and popular. CMV!\\n\\nThis is important to me because I want to be able to write complex, beautiful arrangements with a wide variety of genres (I want to be the musical director of our fusion a Capella group - we do mashups of Indian and Western music). Also because she plays a big part in our group, but I feel like her tastes are incredibly limited. She'd never listen to alt-J or Metric or Lorde even though they are also considered pop and imo make much better music.\\n\\nA bigger part of me thinks this conflict is silly and people like whatever music they like, but I really would like to understand things from her pov.\\n\\n**Edit**: Okay I have three finals coming up and I need to study, so I want to update with my new[er] pov. Thank you for all of you who replied. This truly is very important for me to understand since I'm going to have to arrange music that a group of 14 or so people will all enjoy singing, and that a decent portion of a whole campus full of people with diverse tastes will enjoy. What people enjoy includes music that I don't, and I want to do all music that we perform justice.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, what constitutes originality is subjective to a point, and is also genre specific. My definition of it was harmonic complexity, rhythmic complexity, lyrics (maybe superficial lyrics with subliminal messages), and diversity of different sounds that an artist implements, since that's the genre of the artists in question.\\n\\nThat being said, originality does not correlate with quality, and the fact that the songs are good, even excellent to a lot of different people. The artists are not devoid of musical talent, and they certainly are famous to an extent, but then again, there are a lot of artists who are talented who are not famous. I still hold the opinion that I should be able to evaluate their music for my own personal tastes, and should be able to dislike characteristics that I think are superficial. I have never extended that sentiment to say that my tastes are therefore better. They simply are.\\n\\nLastly, that's exactly it, that peoples' tastes are what they are, and that they have every right to value the music in whichever way they please, and collective values lead to popularity. I'll take this into account when I'm listening to music that someone has suggested and try my best to evaluate the music itself, not the lyrics or the fans or the stigma associated with the artists, but I won't agree to do a song that I genuinely think is bad, even in the context of a mash-up. I trust those in my group to pick good songs.

I'm looking at this through scientific eyes so if you are extra sensitive about race and are just going to try and change my mind with rage, please don't.\\n\\nWhen thinking about this topic, one must look at the entire picture, but here I will just focus on one aspect. It can easily be said that racism is purely a learned practice because how can babies be racist if they haven't grown into the cognitive ability, as far as we know, to see differences in people based on race. So where am I getting this thought?\\n\\nAs said before you need to look at the big picture here. As a species in the animal kingdom, we have evolved from animals who have advanced from the basic reptilian brain to a mammalian brain. Over time, these species evolved into what would inevitably be a human. However, to get to this point, humans needed to compete with all other species to get higher up in the food chain, including other humans. So, since natural selection shows us that the strong survive, at some point the human, or protohuman, brain tells humans that anything different is dangerous. For instance, the first meeting between an African and Caucasian most likely ended in one killing the other simply because they didn't know the the hell it was because of the difference in skin color. \\n\\nOur brains are wired to rely on eyesight more than our other senses so it plays even more of a role in creating biases and over the centuries and millennia, all races, with the natural instinct to defend themselves and survive, only focus on the differences instead of similarities. This is passed down generation to generation through genetics and culture because the people alive believe this is what helped them and there ancestors survive.\\n\\nEDIT: Found this study that says what I'm saying better than I can. \\n\\nhttp://time.com/67092/baby-racists-survival-strategy/\\n\\nTLDR; Because of how humans evolved, biases, namely racial in this topic, are in our DNA and are impossible to just stomp out. The only way to work through it is to realize these biases and how they affect judgement whether you want them to or not.\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I believe that opposition to this viewpoint is mainly driven by the educational establishment (which has a vested interest in dismissing homeschooling), and by a mainstream culture that a) has difficulty accepting something so unusual and b) is typically presented with only the crazy \"fringe\" of homeschooling.\\n\\nBefore I present my reasons for believing this, I want to throw out a few caveats:\\n\\n1) Homeschooling can certainly go wrong, and is a more variable experience. Individual homeschoolers (particularly whose parents have a purely religious reason for homeschooling) will have poor outcomes.\\n\\n2) While ideal, homeschooling is simply not possible for most families, as it requires significant parental involvement and would be next to impossible to conduct without at least one parent staying home.\\n\\n----------------\\n\\n*A note on empirical data*\\n\\nBefore we begin, there is very little empirical data to support the idea that homeschooling produces any sort of negative outcome, and [most opposition is based on the view that the state, rather than parents, should shape a child\\'s education and ideals](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.798508). Until the last 5-10 years, most empirical research that *was* produced was [either small scale, or funded by homeschooling advocates.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.798516) However, as [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.798510] article notes, that\\'s primarily been driven by the fact that educational institutions (which fund almost all educational research) have very little incentive to fund research into a method of education they cannot provide, and therefore have not -- while the smaller scale studies have, despite their funding, been generally rigorous and controlled.\\n\\n\\n*Academic Achievement*\\n\\nHome schooling lets the teacher focus on the individual student\\'s strengths and weaknesses, tailor their curriculum specifically, move rapidly through the things they pick up quickly, spend more time on the things they pick up slowly, and deeply explore what the student finds interesting. Frankly, for me, college was a startlingly boring experience -- because if I understood the material as a child, I could take a test, get an A, and skip forward to something else.\\n\\nThe ability to focus on what interests you makes you *like* learning as a child, and not understand why anyone would not -- and that produces students who are curious for life.\\n\\nLooking at the research, home schooled students unanimously have better educational outcomes ([1](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ641836), [2](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02732173.2014.895640),[3](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01619560701312996) ), and while the homeschooled is more likely to be white and middle class, race and income had no statistical effect on their outcomes -- the only school environment in which they do not. [1](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ893891),[2](https://www.nmu.edu/education/sites/DrupalEducation/files/UserFiles/Moreau_Kathi_MP.pdf)). \\n\\nParents who homeschool for religious reasons [do have poorer outcomes](http://eus.sagepub.com/content/43/3/339.short) than those who do so for academic reasons, but the [majority do it for academic reasons, and religion is declining as a reason to homeschool](http://eus.sagepub.com/content/37/3/307.short).\\n\\n*But what about socialization?*\\n\\nThis question is posed to me in every conversation, and seems to assert that the only way to interact with peers in a class setting. In fact, most homeschooled students [regularly engage with peers and adults outside the home](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ641836), as there are a massive amount of extracurricular activites and coop classes available to homeschoolers -- and [most home schoolers engage frequently with their peers and adults outside the home.](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ641836)\\n\\nIn fact, the key difference is that homeschooled children have *more* agency in who they interact with, and *more* responsibility to act \\'grown up\\'; all of your friendships are voluntary and you can leave any peer group you find toxic or that bullies you, leading to [\"higher quality friendships and better relationships with their parents and other adults. They are happy, optimistic, and satisfied with their lives. Their moral reasoning is at least as advanced as that of other children, and they may be more likely to act unselfishly. As adolescents, they have a strong sense of social responsibility and exhibit less emotional turmoil and problem behaviors than their peers. Those who go on to college are socially involved and open to new experiences. Adults who were homeschooled as children are civically engaged and functioning competently in every way measured so far.\"](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161956X.2013.796825).

I tend to think that, in the absence of an environment that constantly enforces stereotypes, homeschoolers tend to be less sterotypical; often, we *are* pretty nerdy, because there\\'s no group of \"cool kids\" that we want to be like -- so if we like trains, we\\'re going to learn all about some goddamn trains. But fundamentally, that\\'s *good*. You can learn to look cool in college, when you\\'re not a needy teenager and you realize how fundamentally unimportant it is.\\n\\n*Not everyone can homeschool, and not everyone should.*\\n\\nI\\'m NOT advocating that every parent homeschool; only those who can afford to invest the time it requires, and who are willing to take the significant financial impact of losing one parent\\'s income.\\n\\nLikewise, I\\'m NOT advocating that there be no regulation of homeschooling; I\\'ve got no issue with requiring standardized testing to ensure that students are learning, and I\\'ve got no issue with requiring periodic medical tests to ensure students are healthy. What I DO have an issue with is governmental control of the curriculum -- if it produces good results (healthy knowledge, reading ability, mathematical skills, etc), then the more variation we have in educational styles, the better.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don\\'t see the difference between the world as it is and an an-cap society in general. An organization known as \"The United States\", and before that, the 13 colonies, declared ownership of large swaths of property and declared it as its own. The United States then re-sells this property to its citizens with strings-attached contracts. Hell, condo owners are forced to pay maintenance fees. US citizens are also forced to pay a fee for having land and making money within the United States. You were never sold that property unconditionally. \"Oh, but I never signed an explicit contract!\" Well, you have exactly as much protection from bad contracts in the real world as you do in the Anarcho Capitalist world: Zero. It\\'s too bad you aren\\'t rich enough to afford protection for your rights. \\n\\n\\nAlso, every US citizen is free to leave the territory of the United States for better pastures elsewhere. It just so happens that better pastures have also been declared as owned by other groups of people known as \"nations\". Moreover, the United States oftentimes makes contractual agreements with its neighbors to extradite criminals. In the AnCap society, the exact same kind of agreements can be made. These nations re-sell their own property through a similar contractual system. Their citizens are also free to leave (or at least most of them) for better pastures, if they can find them. \\n\\n\\n\\n**All An-cappers want to do is hit a magical reset button to destroy government and let it reform under a different name.** Maybe they\\'ll call it a homeowner\\'s association. Maybe they\\'ll call it a corporation. They want to hit the reset button, because this time around, maybe they can then grab a bigger piece for themselves. \\n\\n\\nAn-Cappers might object to my criticism because the last time our world was formed, violence and aggression was \"legal\" and \"allowed\". Well, violence and aggression obviously will not magically disappear the second time around when they hit the reset button. Without a monopolizing, governing body to restrict or regulate violence, then nothing will be different the second time around. Bad corporations/businesses/governments will do bad things, and nobody will be there to stop it, just like since the dawn of human history. Everyone can even agree that bad things are bad or that aggression is bad, but they\\'ll just go ahead and do it anyways when it just so happens to help themselves.

It surely wouldn\\'t work after the An-caps hit their reset button. \\n_____\\n\\n\\nThe Ancap utopia has no differences whatsoever to the world as it is today. As in our world, there is no governing authority that demands that everybody follow the Non-Aggression-Principle or that people respect each others rights. Without enforcement, everybody will just do whatever they want to. Bad people will do bad things if they can get away with it. Power will be conglomerated eventually into super-corporations that would eventually resemble the governments we see today. Just like our own world, after the big corporations have seized all the valuable property, they can then govern however the fuck they please. \"My House, My Rules. If you don\\'t like it, then just get off of my property!\" Eventually, after the corporations have taken over, the next generation of anarcho capitalists will grumble about how evil their new corporate/government overlords are.

This sentiment is famously articulated, for instance, in Gil Scott-Heron\\'s poem \"Whitey on the Moon\". In the case of the annual budget allocation of the US (assuming space is not privatized), giving more funding to NASA means giving less funding to public schools and other social benefits.\\n\\nIs our planet really so trashed that there is no hope whatsoever for us to reduce our emissions and save it?

Would it make it easier for us to ignore the miserable if all the wealthy people could just ship off to another planet?\\n\\nOn a more practical level, I think that if you are a government that values \"technological progress\", and one dimension of this is space exploration, then you get a better return on \"technological progress\" per investment in education. Some people are skeptical that increasing funding for our public education systems will change the results, but I think that simply increasing the wage of teachers could significantly increase the quality of teachers. That is to say, a lot of the most talented students in the US are going into finance because that\\'s how they can make the most money, but it would be better for our country/world (and its \"technological progress\") if they went into engineering or education, which could partially be achieved by increasing the wages of public school teachers.\\n\\nEssentially, by focusing on education instead of space exploration, we could teach our kids to teach our grandkids .... to teach our descendants how to travel to Mars (efficiently and safely) when such a move is actually relevant for humanity.

For those of you who are unaware, it is still a felony/against the law to resist an unlawful arrest - meaning that as a citizen obeying the law, in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you, and you aren\\'t even allowed to flinch.\\n\\nI think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense, so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. \\n\\nNow I\\'m not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force - but there needs to be some protection for civilians \\'resisting in a reasonable fashion\\'. That may not be the perfect wording or solution, but its coming from a layman. \\n\\n---------\\nEdit*\\n\\n&gt;The reason resisting arrest is illegal is to protect the civilian being arrested.

Following this, the doctor then goes to doctor court where he has taken an oath to do his best to argue that you have a certain disease (regardless of whether he actually believes you have that disease). Another doctor is there who has taken an oath to do his best to argue that you do not have that disease (also regardless of his own beliefs on whether or not you have the disease). Each doctor presents their case in an adversarial fashion to a group of 12 of your peers (who, in our hypothetical, probably have biases against certain types of diseases and demographics) taken off of the street and selected by the doctors presumably in ways to take advantage of their biases to further their own case, and their presentation must conform to certain rules that do not admit of certain types of evidence being permitted and being thrown out. Then when all is said and done, those twelve ordinary people go and deliberate and then make a decision about whether you are sick or healthy. Their decision determines if, when, and what kind of treatment you will get.\\n\\nThe previous example is absurd and no one would have any confidence in our healthcare system if it were like that, because it wouldn't be very good at finding the truth of whether or not a person is sick. \\n\\nThe legal system is a bit different in that there are things that we value more than getting at the truth, such as keeping innocent people out of jail, to the extent that we are willing to let criminals go free to keep people out of jail, but I do not think that these values are fulfilled by our legal system. In many ways, our legal system works against them. For example, we have relatively uneducated (at least concerning the level of deductive reasoning and legal knowledge that is probably necessary to evaluate criminal cases) and highly biased people making decisions about the guilt or innocence of a person. This can very easily lead to more convictions for innocent people, and I wouldn't be surprised if in fact it does lead to more convictions for minorities, even if we were to have roughly identical cases.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

While I get that these people are coming from a good place, I don\\'t think it\\'s the right thing to do for the following reasons.\\n\\nIt\\'s ultimately very condescending.

Very few people face their own flaws and never do anything about them because they are fed this \"love yourself no matter what\" BS, so they go on with a bad personality or a bad diet and never wonder what they are doing wrong, but instead blame other people (Or in this case, the media) for their problems. \\n\\nI can appreciate people who see the flaws in themselves because then they can take the next step and work to improve themselves.

If you haven\\'t been there, its full of pictures of what people have put up on their tumblr pages, making fun of their thoughts about feminism and \"social justice\". I couldn\\'t really understand the humor of it though, because all of the posts there revolve around a concept I didn\\'t know about, with confusing words such as \"cisgender\", \"gender binary\" as well as \"kins\" etc. After finally understanding the humor of the entire thing, I\\'ve become really interested in the all of these definitions. \\n\\nI was suprised to learn that not believing in a gender binary however was considered PC. Moreover, after checking out a couple of TEDx talks and articles I have found that they all [reference these four graphs or scales](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1600-Genderbread-Person.jpg). I\\'ll just go through all of these expressions and tell you what I believe. \\n\\nSexual Orientation: I believe in the three terms for sexual orientation, but I dont see any reason to have a graph or a scale, there is no reason to put someone for instance inbetween straight and gay. If you happen to go more for women than men, that would still render you bi. I dont see the reason for the spectrum.\\n\\nBiological Sex: I only believe in male and female. Not intersex nor anything inbetween. If you happen to be transgendered, then I guess you would also want an operation to completely change into the other sex, thus making you the other biological sex. (If you are refering to the biological sex the body has for some in depth medical reason, then I think that just needs to stay between you and the doctor). If you happend to be born with both sets of reproductive organs then you still are one of the two, completely biologically - you\\'d just need an operation. So yeah, I have no idea what intersex means. If someone says they dont feel as if they are either a boy or a girl and therefore invented that intersex thing, I\\'d say they are basing that upon gender stereotypes - which is a somewhat bad thing. They should go with their biological sex, if they dont feel as the opposite.\\n\\nGender expression: Isn\\'t this again based on stereotypes? I guess you could rank someone on your perception of how masculine and feminine they are, but that is still based on your perseptions on what boys and girls should be like. I mean.. I dont really see the point of there being a graph for that.. And I dont see why anyone would want to come across as \"androgynous\", but why we have a term for that suprises me even more. \\n\\nGender Identity: You are either a man or a woman. Atleast thats what I believe. As I mentioned in the paragraph about biological sex; I dont understand why these two wouldnt be the same. If they weren\\'t you would hopefully change that, unless you are afraid of the consequences or something. Genderqueer? wut? \\n\\nIf I understood it correctly it\\'s gender identity which it is the most focus on. Its the binary of the gender identity which is the \"gender binary\", right? Or are all of these points a part of what you define as \"gender\"?\\n\\nI believe all of these expressions are made up by people who want to feel different and special. They happen to not feel exactly like the rest, (much like everyone else, ever) and therefore think there is something special about them. I think this is also the case for the \"kins\", for those of you who\\'s been on /r/tumblrinaction.\\n\\nThanks!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If your partner wants to change their last name to yours themself for whatever reason (doesn\\'t like their name, bad family relationships...) then of course its different because it\\'s their choice - as long as you\\'d be cool if they didn\\'t.\\n\\n2. If you expected it on a very vague level of never thinking about it so you just naturally assumed it was what people did, I guess that is fine (even though I am surprised by not noticing the obvious unfairness), as long as after starting to question it you came to the conclusion it isn;t a fair expectation.\\n\\n\\n3. I am not telling people what their criteria in relationships should be, or whom to be with. If you don\\'t want to marry someone who won\\'t take your name, that\\'s your right, just as it is to have any condition you can imagine since the other doesn\\'t have to agree with it. However, it is disrespectful. You might want to be in a relationship with someone you don\\'t see as equally important as yourself, you may want your relationship to be disrespectful - all fair enough. My argument is simply that it is disrespectful.\\n\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWell obviously, you are making an assumtion that your family name is more important than theirs. Name is a great part of identity to many people. You are saying they should change theirs to yours. \\n\\nYou want them to do something that you aren\\'t willing to do yourself because you clearly hold yoursefl to a different standard. Now, sometimes two people do different things for each other because they have different needs, but that only works as long as it isn\\'t based on one person actually expecting the other to do what they themselves don\\'t want to but rather on the other wanting to do something they don\\'t. \\n\\nFor instance, your partner is more social and always introducing you to people and initiating mutual friendships. You are not doing it for them. however, they do so because they want to. If they were to stop wanting to do it and you still felt you had the right to demand it of them, although you pefrectly understood why they would have a problem with it (you not being able to do it yourself), your demand would become disrespectful. \\n\\n\\nA respectful partnership is equal - that doesn\\'t mean both sides need to actually act the same, but they shouldn\\'t be demanding things from the other that they wouldn\\'t be willing to do themselves. \\n\\n\\nThis demand especially, because it is so simple, is incredibly unreasonable and an offense to your partners whole identity. I can\\'t see how anyone can disagree or excuse it. \\n\\n\\nEdit: So main argument is \"it\\'s tradition.\" Well traditions can be very unfair and sexist, and as far as I know, we don\\'t have to follow them if there is no good or positive reason to. There is nothing sacred about tradition that somehow makes it above any other assumption of behavior.

Because of this, I believe that the threats and trolling these women have experienced has greatly helped their cause. People unfamiliar with the games industry who read these articles are led to believe that a large portion of those opposing these women are psychopath basement dwellers making rape threats. Because this narrative helps their movement so much, I believe that feminists who support the actions of these women can definitely help their movement by creating many fake, anonymous accounts and viciously threatening feminist public figures with them. Drawing from this, while hardcore members of Gamergate have undoubtedly trolled and threatened these women, I believe a decent portion of the vitriol against these women is posted by their supporters.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In my opinion, Nintendo has historically had, by far, the best first-party games of any console.

I also believe that the N64 was, when compared to the standards of its day, the best console ever made. That said, they have dwindled to a niche company that is pretty much limited to selling to gamers under the age of 12, and adults who are willing to buy an entire console just to play Smash and Mario Kart with their friends while high (I am one of those people so I don't judge). I have a PS4 too, and would say I spend at least 75% of my gaming time, and well over 90% of my gaming budget on games for it despite adoring all things Nintendo. The reason for this is simple. The third-party support for Nintendo is shit. It's nearly impossible to find a decent game for the Wii or Wii U that isn't first party. And the reason for this is obvious. The wacky controllers. Aside from a limited number of applications that get old real fast, these controllers are awful. How are devs supposed to make a good game for them? Even when playing first party games that are optimized for them and that are stellar in quality, like Twilight Princess and Super Mario Galaxy, I find myself wishing I had a normal style controller in my hands. IMO Nintendo could have created a console that was, in essence, a clone of the PS4/XB1 and been way more successful. Third party devs would make all their games available for it, rather than shit-quality ports that come out much later (ie Watch Dogs). This would, in turn, encourage way more people to buy the console and, more importantly, games for it. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

After having engaged in numerous debates with people on this issue, I\\'ve heard countless reasons why people think porn is wrong or immoral. I will just go over three main ones and explain why college football is much worse.\\n\\n1) Porn is wrong because it monetizes someone\\'s body in a way that compromises their health and integrity.\\n\\nThe hypocrisy in this statement is astounding, coming from anyone who is involved in college football. So having sex in front of a camera jeopardizes someone\\'s health and integrity. But having 250lb men who can run like track stars repeatedly bashing into each others\\' heads as hard as they can doesn\\'t? \\n\\n2) Porn sets an unrealistic expectations of body image for young girls.\\n\\nWhat is more of an unreasonable expectation? For a girl to be maybe slightly more attractive than average(with all the fetishes in porn these days, there is an ever broadening acceptance of body types). Or for a boy to be 6\\'4\", 250lbs, 5% body fat, able to bench 400 lbs, and run a 4.4 40? \\n\\n3) Porn is wrong because people are selling their bodies.\\n\\nOn a certain level, isn\\'t everyone selling their body? Even the most basic and mundane of office jobs require you to use your fingers to type. I imagine a lot of folks will not want to get into a debate on that deep of a subjective topic though, so I will just stick to comparing it to college football. AT LEAST they\\'re actually selling their body and getting compensated for it. Better than constantly engaging in brutal physical contact, risking serious injury and even death in some cases; not even receiving a dime. All this while the schools and owners of the NCAA make millions upon millions as a result of your hard labor and suffering. The free education argument doesn\\'t fly either. Everyone knows that barely half of students who went to college focused on academics are able to find a job upon graduation. Let alone \"student-athletes\", who everyone knows takes filler classes in pointless majors; has other students on campus do their homework so they may remain academically eligible. \\n\\nCMV\\n\\nEDIT: A few common arguments that keep popping up so I will just address them here so I don\\'t have to copy and paste over and over. \\n\\n#1) STDs are rampant in the porn industry\\n\\nPorn stars are actually 80% LESS likely to get an STD than a member of the general public of the same age.\\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1cu016/til_professional_porn_actors_are_80_percent_less/\\nI wonder how much less likely they\\'d be to get one than say, the popular captain of the football team?\\n\\n#2) Football provides an avenue for future career opportunities that porn does not.\\nhttp://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/dan-marino-vince-young-broke-nfl-players-lost-fortunes/\\nIf this is true, why are 78% of NFL players going broke within two years of retirement? If these colleges are doing such a good job teaching football players valuable life and career lessons. Why is it that even the most gifted, the top 1% who make the NFL, can\\'t apply those valuable lessons 2 years removed from the end of their careers?\\n\\n#3) Another common argument I\\'ve seen is this: \"Porn doesn\\'t make their workers any happier or healthier. Football does through encouraging exercise and teaching life lessons.\"\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PepuR7rxSw\\nHere is an interview which is backed by a study that shows porn stars are happier, healthier, more likely to be content with their body, and less likely to have an STD than the average woman. \\n\\n'},\n {'title': \"CMV: If there is no God then life is meaningless.

This topic isn\\'t about moderates who only support gun use for hobbies and recreation.\\n\\n**tl;dr, or the way I should\\'ve phrased the thread initially: CMV: Abortion is a form of self-defense. Those who believe you have the right to use deadly force in self-defense should also support abortion in at least some cases, if not all.** \\n\\nThe main justification for being pro-gun is that people need guns to defend themselves. Unique to arguing that people should carry guns as opposed to pepper spray or other self-defense tools is that guns are used to kill, not incapacitate. By being pro-gun, you are pro-giving people the right to choose to kill another person. A circumstance in which you would be allowed to do so under the castle doctrine, stand your ground laws, etc. would be that the other person is threatening your property or body. Pro-gun activists can\\'t really argue that you have to know your attacker intends to kill you, as by the time you know they mean to kill you (as opposed to rob you, assault you, etc.) it\\'s likely too late for your gun to be effective. Ultimately, the pro-gun argument relies on one ordinary person being given the power to decide to end someone else\\'s life, without the need for lengthy deliberation that state-administered capital punishment requires.\\n\\nNext, the main justification for being pro-life is that fetuses have \"personhood\" and deserve the same rights as people. If you\\'re pro-gun, however, you\\'re arguing that someone has the right to kill another person if that person is intruding on their property or threatening their body. This definitively rules out cases where the mother\\'s health is at risk and the mother would choose to preserve her own life first, as in [the infamous recent case of a woman dying in Ireland of medical complications after being denied an abortion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) However, it can be more broadly applied to other, less critical abortions. For the same reason you would be justified in shooting to kill someone who is assaulting you or entering your home, you should be justified in killing someone who is literally occupying your body for months. At the very least, abortion must be legalized in cases of rape, as you never consented to even the possibility of having a person invade your body/property. \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t mean pro-gun people are in any way obligated to personally prefer abortion for themselves (just as they may not choose to shoot an intruder within their home), but they should support legal abortion on the basis that others should be given that choice. \\n\\nA counterargument I can foresee is that to someone who is pro-gun, an attacker forfeits their right to life by being a criminal, and fetuses are innocent. However, this argument doesn\\'t really fly. Firstly, there\\'s no way of knowing why an intruder has entered your home - maybe they were forced to by someone else or coerced into it. Secondly, even if a fetus has technically not consciously committed a crime, it is still by its very existence invading another person\\'s body/property if that person did not consent to it being there. If you invite a person/fetus into your home/body you don\\'t have the right to kill them, but in order to remain logically consistent you should be able to remove them with deadly force in both cases.\\n\\nFinally, there\\'s no corollary here - because pro-choice arguments don\\'t rely on personhood, there\\'s no hypocrisy in being pro-gun rights or pro-gun control because it\\'s a completely separate issue.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It makes absolutely no sense to spend tens of thousands of dollars (if not more) on an education with limited earning potential, when you could use that same time, money, and effort to obtain an education in a field that will allow you to earn enough money to have the freedom to do what you like later in life.\\n\\nIn order to weed out the people who only read the headline, and don't bother to read the entire view, please start all responses with any one of the following words: Orange, Seven, Banana, Coffee. \\n\\n  \\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nEdit: I'm going to get to the responses as fast as I can, but they're piling up fast. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It does not deserve to be acknowledged as one of the greatest anime shows.',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2nvy5j',\n  'selftext': 'Let me preface this by saying that I really do like Cowboy Bebop. The animation and designs are sublime, the soundtrack is fantastic, the action is great, and when all three come together the show can occasionally become a jaw dropping audiovisual masterpiece, particularly in the breathtaking finale.\\n\\nHowever, there are so many problems with it that I cannot in good faith call it a \"masterpiece\" or proclaim it to be one of the best of the medium as anything other than a gateway show.\\n\\nI\\'ll start off with the characters, which is where many of my problems lie. I\\'ll admit, Spike and Jet are great characters, but they are only 2/5 of the entire Bebop Crew. Ein\\'s introduction as a \"data dog\" or otherwise hyperintelligent canine goes nowhere and he spends the rest of the show just being the crew\\'s pet. Faye exhibits many of the worst characteristics that can be written about a female character; she\\'s bossy, greedy, obsessed with her own beauty, needs to either be rescued or is a hinderance to the group more often than an asset, she often wears revealing clothing for the sole purpose of fanservice. Ed is hit or miss, and walks the line between endearing and annoying, but hardly receives much development beyond her introductory episode.\\n\\nThe main villain Vicious is especially bad. He has very little character and motivation aside from a desire for more power, and even though the show goes a bit into his backstory it never establishes motivation. At the end of the show, Vicious is little more than an evil guy in a black coat with enough fighting skill that it makes Spike struggle to land a bullet in him, aside from the obvious fact that Vicious becomes a representation of the syndicate Spike ran away from. As a result the five episodes that involve him (Sympathy for the Devil, Jupiter Jazz pts 1/2, and Real Folk Blues pts 1/2) don\\'t leave me feeling as if they are as spectacular as the show wants me to feel like they are.\\n\\nAside from that, the quality of the episodes varies dramatically. For an episodic show that only has about five episodes that build a overall story, that\\'s saying a lot. Sure, there are fantatsic episodes such as Waltz for Venus and Ganymede Elegy, but there are also fairly ho hum episodes such as Bohemian Raphsody, Speak Like a Child, and Boogie Woogie Feng Shui.\\n\\nReddit, help me appreciate this show and tell me what I\\'m missing.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There\\'s no real reason you shouldn\\'t be allowed to marry your brother, or marry five of your brothers for that matter. \\n\\nNeither pedophilia/hebephilia or bestiality have as many of the \"negative effects\" that society seems to believe exist. Many underage persons in consensual sexual relationships are brought before society and told they were raped and scarred for life, despite their constant defense of the older party. While animals can\\'t verbally consent, there are many blatant signs when an animal is \"in heat\". It doesn\\'t help that there are many videos on the internet of animals having sex with humans on their own accord.\\n\\nWhile I myself am none of these things, I believe that they should be treated equally. Love isn\\'t something that is bound by arbitrary laws set by the government, it knows no bounds.\\n\\nEdit: It seems people are misunderstanding my point on marriage. I\\'m only applying it to polygamy and incest, as children/animals would have no benefit in marriage.\\n\\nEdit 2: I don\\'t mean for kids of any age to be having sex with any adult, just for the age of consent to be lowered to a reasonable level. When kids start having sex (with each other) as early as 10, it\\'s not good to suppress someone\\'s sexuality until they become \"of age\".\\n\\nEdit 3: Was gone all day, and I\\'m getting tired of having to repeat myself multiple times while on a tablet. If you\\'re serious about changing my view, send me a PM and I promise I\\'ll dedicate time to discussion with you. Thanks for all the replies!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There\\'s a reason why 4K TVs are moving into the 85\" range, because the average viewing distance of most people barely takes full advantage of most of the 1080p tvs in people\\'s houses right now.\\n\\nFurthermore, to go to 4K you have to dump your plasma in favor of arguably inferior LCD/LED technology that fails to produce effective black levels for the most part in comparison.

However, I do research in quantum chemistry and materials science, and thus my conclusions about life are very evidence-based.  However, I am not a positivist. (Why not? Roughly because I could imagine the Standard Model having fields that don\\'t have interaction mechanisms with the other fields.  See the weak coupling gluons have for instance.  The fact that there may not be a \"field chain\" leading to our human senses is not, in my opinion, a good argument for the nonexistence of those fields.)\\n\\nWith regard to my religious beliefs, I subscribe to the philosophies of Christ and the Christian religion (treat others kindly, turn the other cheek, etc.), but I believe the miracles in the Bible are simply parables, and it is not likely that they actually occurred.  I do, however, believe in God, mainly because of the fact that I have experiential consciousness (as opposed to neurological consciousness); meaning, of all things I am certain of, I am *most* certain of the fact that I am experiencing my own existence.  Everything else could essentially be faked with sufficient enough technology.  I\\'m not looking to get into a debate about p-zombies; I\\'m just presenting my viewpoint on religion so you have some background to work with.\\n\\nThus, I do believe that God (whatever form He takes) created the laws of physics, and from those laws everything else came about.  And experiential consciousness implies to me that God ultimately intended the existence of beings capable of experiencing the universe that came about from the laws He created.  So there is at least a small \"personal\" aspect to God, as opposed to a godless universe full of automatons obeying uncreated time-transformation rules.\\n\\nHowever, that\\'s the limit of the \"personal\" nature of God for me.  **Most religions believe that God is loving and caring, but I\\'m not so sure.  Here\\'s my reasons why:**\\n\\n**1)** For one thing, God has never communicated directly with us; at least not in a way that everyone can believe with certainty, and definitely not with me personally (and if He ever did, I completely missed it.  It was too subtle.)  Why would a loving God leave us so bereft of communication?\\n\\n**2)** Following up #1, there is no indication at all of what happens when we die.  Every religion thinks something different happens, and heck, even the individual religions are totally lacking in specifics.  The Bible says \"eternal life\" and \"roads paved with gold\" (which is clearly nonliteral) and not a whole lot more.  Why would a God who loves us torture us with the constant uncertainty about our ultimate fate?  I can never enjoy any happy moment, because in the back of my mind, there is the lingering thought that ultimately my existence might be pointless, and the net result of everything will be the same as if I had never existed at all.\\n\\n**3)** Pain and suffering.  My mom died from cancer.  A girl about my age (who was valedictorian of her class in HS, a kind person, and an extremely hard worker) died of bone cancer.  My grandfather died of brain cancer.  My neighbors were killed less than a month ago by a drunk driver, leaving their three kids parentless.  How many millions died in the Holocaust?  How many are being tortured in North Korea right now?  Children are dying of starvation left and right.  People are constantly raped, murdered, and sold into slavery.  Freak accidents kill people in terrifically painful ways.  Do I really need to spell out the obvious here?\\n\\nDoes any of this sound like what most people call \"love\"?  Invent a new word for it, because it sure doesn\\'t match any definition of \"love\" I\\'ve ever heard.  I am unable to come up with a good counterargument to the above three points, and I have been trying for years, because I desperately want to believe in a kind, loving God.  Unlike some people, I\\'m incapable of putting aside logic and believing whatever makes me feel better.  I don\\'t say that in a mean way; in fact I envy the traditionalists who are raised to believe that everything is going to be okay in the end and who don\\'t think any further about it.  That would make life much less depressing for me.\\n\\n**To go ahead and preempt some of the common objections I can imagine:**\\n\\n**1)** God has a plan.  This objection comes up due to the idea that God is infinite and incomprehensible, and that He has a plan that we cannot understand.  Pain and suffering are trivialities that in the end won\\'t matter much.  Well, the funny thing about God\\'s plan is that it looks a lot like the plan of somebody who doesn\\'t have one.  I have no issue with God being infinite and incomprehensible, but why does that automatically make His plan beneficial or caring toward us humans?  That is a leap that requires explanation.\\n\\n**2)** God gave us free will.  So person-to-person evil is not God\\'s doing, but man\\'s.  Okay, but even assuming free will, He is still allowing extraordinary evil to occur.  I can think of plenty of methods to retain free will while preventing harm to others (we work toward this goal all the time in society).\\n\\n**3)** God doesn\\'t exist, and thus your argument is based on a faulty premise.  Well, that would be a different CMV, wouldn\\'t it?  See if you can CMV with the constraint of an extant God.  There\\'s plenty of people who believe in God AND believe He is loving; I just want them to support their viewpoint and convince me of it.\\n\\n**EDIT:** I don\\'t really like the harsh, accusatory tone of these replies.  As someone with intense social anxiety, I was hoping this sub-reddit might be a little better about cordial replies that the rest of Reddit, but it doesn\\'t seem that way.

It stands to reason that when it comes to referencing centuries versus specific years, that the numerical system rather than the ordinal system is obviously superior; we can both designate the \"1900s\" and \"1914\", but we cannot designate an individual year with \"20th century.\"\\n\\nThis system also makes it more difficult for non-English speakers to understand, as they have enough on their plate figuring out our mish-mash of a language, let alone how many dates they could get wrong during translation. Hell, I sometimes get it wrong when I\\'m not paying enough attention, especially when it gets back into less recent history - English speakers know automatically that \"19th century\" and \"20th century\" refer to 1800s and 1900s, but how many of us automatically make the shift when we hear \"7th century\"?\\n\\nThe only issue I can see is that when discussing Roman-era history, around the time 100 BC-100 AD, it might make referring to the \"1st Century\", 1-100 AD a little more difficult. However, the problem persists even in BC with the confusion of the ordinal century lagging behind the actual year date. \\n\\nMy CMV is that this is a confusing system and bad for international students, casual readers, and even for historians and archaeologists. The below proposal is just a suggestion for discussion, and shredding it, as I\\'m sure this subreddit will, will **not necessarily** change my view on the whole subject.\\n\\nTherefore, I think that, when referencing these two centuries, it might be more instructive to refer to them in a similar manner that some refer to the most recent full decade, the \"oughts\". Given that 2000 is technically part of the 1990s, this means that 2001-2010 are referred to on occasion as the \"oughts\" when referring to decades, in lieu of the \\'20s, \\'30s, and so forth. So we should refer to the 1st century AD as \"the ought century\" AD, and then continue with 100s AD, 200s AD, and same for BC.\\n\\nThat was just a suggestion.

My sister was speaking about leaving her money to her kids after her passing, and I casually mentioned how I don\\'t believe I\\'d leave any. This was met with much more vitriol from both my mom and sister than I expected. Since my sister only seems to argue by using mindless platitudes (she just kept saying \"you take care of your own\" over and over) and my mother just kept telling me \"that is wrong\" without explaining why, I\\'d like to have a discussion on it here to see if I really am mislead in my views. Consider the following scenario:\\n\\nI have amassed a large fortune and have grown to be about 80. I had my kids in my 30s, and so they are now in their 40s. My assumption would be that during the first 20 or so years, I have taken care of their educational costs, provided for their basic needs, and hopefully shown them the value of a dollar while still allowing them a life not bound by severe monetary constraints. After their 20s, when they have begun providing for themselves, I will be there as a back-up should something truly catastrophic and unforeseen happen, but they would be largely left to their own devices. After 20 or so years of that, when I die, I would plan on leaving all my wealth to charities of my choice. I don\\'t even think I\\'d leave anything for the grandkids\\' education as I believe that falls under the responsibility of the parents or even the children to properly finance and plan.\\n\\nThe reasoning:\\n\\nStatistics: 60% of the second-generation blow all the inheritance money during their lifetime. That statistic climbs to 90% when you move into the third-generation. To me, this indicates that leaving a large inheritance to children who did not work for the money leads them to invest it poorly and blow it on frivolous spending (I\\'m not saying this happens in all cases, as I know medical bills and a billion other situations could arise that would necessitate the costs, but I\\'m saying it is the most common reason).\\n\\nEthics: I don\\'t believe that people should benefit simply by being born into a beneficial situation. Being born to wealthy parents shouldn\\'t be like winning the lottery for your entire life. As I mentioned, these kids would not feel the claws of poverty during their entire childhood; why should they be guaranteed these \"lottery winnings\" well into adult life, when they are supposed to be responsible for themselves? Moreover, leaving this wealth to the children will actually negatively affect their lives, as it will foster laziness and lack of ambition. Nearly every tycoon, from Carnegie to Buffett to Gates has noted that leaving anything more than a small sum of money to their children would be terrible for their ambition and their motivation to make something of their lives.\\n\\nSome final comments: I understand that this is putting the cart WAY before the horse. I don\\'t have considerable wealth. I don\\'t even have kids. This is just how I believe I\\'d behave in this scenario given my current mindset. Furthermore, I really don\\'t want to come off as miserly, but if I do, please tell me. Anyway, beyond that, please try and change my view!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I advocate conceal carrying and think the law abiding citizen should own whatever they want. However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \\n\\n**Argument**\\n\\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that\\'s right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that’s the gun they should own.*\\n\\nThat\\'s my standard argument, but there\\'s a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\\n\\n**AR15**\\n\\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here\\'s what I think of them, personally.\\n\\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it\\'s a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone\\'s AR, they\\'ll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It\\'s like Lego\\'s, except each “brick” runs about $80 to $1000 and they\\'re pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \\n\\n**Home defense**\\n\\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge. And you can get a semi-auto shotgun with a high capacity magazines, tactical rails, and with any kind of grip or stock you want. I think those are better than an AR15. 12 gauge is so versatile, you can buy the right ammo for the kind of place you live, with more flexibility than what the .223 or 56x45mm has. Where an AR15 will over penetrate and risk hitting neighbors, in a firefight, you can get the exact rounds you need to protect yourself, be effective, and not kill anyone through drywall with 12guage, which you can easily find at in most stores that sell ammo. If you predict your firefight is only going to be defending your apartment from an intruder, then 12 gauge bird shot is  the lethal choice against a human threat and considerate of your neighbor’s safety. Yes, bird shot, despite what experts say. I know what I’m talking about, because I’ve screwed around a lot with 12 gauge bird shot, and at 7 feet you can cut through a 4“x4“ block of wood with the cheap stuff. If you’re not worried about neighbors, you can get slugs or buckshot. So an AR might be a good choice for home defense, but it’s more expensive than the best choice for home defense. \\n\\n**2A:Uprising**\\n\\nIs the AR15 a necessary part of the 2nd amendment? I think the U.S. would collapse before we’d get a chance to overthrow it. But if we did, we’d depend on our military going AWOL first, then we’d have a fighting chance. It also would be bloody. I can’t even imagine what the U.S. would have to be in order for us to get to that point, but I don’t think we have to worry about that any time soon. However, if people want to prep for that, in case they need their AR *later*, I don’t see a problem, but that doesn’t help me argue why people need one *now*.  \\n\\n**2A:Invasion**\\n\\nDoes it owning the AR scare off potential foreign invaders from? Sure, but don’t all of our guns do that? We have 300 million of them. If China was able to invade (lol... let’s pretend, ok?) , they’d have to put up with the locals as they drove down our streets, which would involve vehicle blockades and home made bombs, in addition to guns. \\n\\n**Thanks**\\n\\nHelp me out, guys.

Some were kept in concentration camps and 200,000 were employed in forced labor in Poland - others were sent to Russia. \\n\\nGermany accepted this and did not fight back. Nowadays, the existence of Poland is not controversial.

During World War I, British forces defeated the Ottomans (who were in a military alliance with the Germans) in Southern Syria and [governed that area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine).

They [declared the establishment of a Jewish State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence). This state was quickly recognized by the United States, the Soviet Union and many other countries. This immediately resulted in [war with the surrounding Arab nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War).

I don\\'t believe this is possible without dire consequences that outweigh whatever benefits may exist. There have been quite a few CMVs arguing AGAINST this particular view of mine, including one that was mistitled to make it look like he agreed with me.\\n\\nTo clarify, I\\'m not endorsing the status quo in terms of drug policy. I personally think the drugs that are illegal should be the worst in terms of dependence and bodily harm. For instance, I personally don\\'t use marijuana but I believe it\\'s ridiculous that cannabis use is illegal while alcohol and tobacco, much more harmful and addictive drugs, are legal. This CMV applies to crack, heroin, powder cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, etc. I\\'m opposed to the legalization of drugs that have much higher addiction potential and are much more bodily harmful than drugs that are currently legal. I also do think it’s a good idea to focus more state effort on addiction recovery.\\n\\nThe main argument for the legalization of ALL substances is that it will allegedly curb the power of drug cartels that commit horrendous acts of violence all over the world. I\\'ve heard a lot of vague arguments that we should \"tax and regulate\" these drugs in order to curb abuse while cutting cartel profits. These two goals are generally at odds with each other. Any effective method of undercutting cartels will make hard drugs more available to everyone. You can regulate them all you want, but you’ll only accomplish the intended purpose of cutting profits to drug cartels if you make cocaine and heroin easier to get elsewhere. I believe that there will be more addicts and heavy drug users if this is the case.\\n\\nCurrently, there are more tobacco and alcohol users in the US than marijuana users, and I credit that to the fact that marijuana is illegal and harder to get. This is DESPITE the fact that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful and addictive than marijuana. Sure, you’ll be able to get your hands on it if you really want to, but the law does deter millions. Imagine if cocaine and heroin were sold in stores like tobacco is now. Would you feel safe going to the store knowing that an addict might be holding it up for his fix? Would you feel safe letting your kids go to college, knowing that a senior could purchase them a lifelong addiction and possible early death at the 7-11?\\n\\nI understand that many children already live in an environment where drugs are readily available, but millions of others are stopped from using hard drugs by the presence of the law, and we need to stop and think whether we want to give that away over libertarian principles or possible mitigation of street violence. \\n\\nAs for the libertarian argument that it\\'s a state infringement upon rights, I personally find rights to be a bit more nuanced than that, and the most simply-worded right isn\\'t always the one that should prevail in a given situation. In this case I consider my right to protection from addicts and addictive substances more important than others’ rights to use those substances. There are horrible costs to the “War on Drugs,” but I don’t see any feasible alternative in the realm of legalizing all addictive substances.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

When did we decide that just because you fuck someone else, you clearly \"love\" them or you\\'re being \"disrespectful\"? Let me clarify some things:\\n\\n-I agree sex feels pretty good, possibly better, when it\\'s with someone you truly care about.\\n\\n-If we\\'re all biologically programmed to find the opposite sex attractive, how could we possibly never want to fuck other people in a committed relationship? Why is that thought/act something to be considered disrespectful? It\\'s just sex.\\n\\n-What you consider a relationship is subjective to YOU, I acknowledge that.

Maybe I do it, maybe I don\\'t, but I don\\'t respect my partner any less because of it.\\n\\nBasically I don\\'t see how a person in a relationship fucking someone else is entirely a bad thing, it just *is*.

The verdict was fucked up.  I feel as if he could have been found guilty of manslaughter. 6 shots? YES. That is excessive. Four were to the hands/arm and two to the head.

I think it is much more likely that the officer simply had to make a hasty decision and went a bit over the top.

Part of me thinks the outrage is largely due to the fact that people have associated Mike Brown with a greater (and admittedly perfectly legitimate) problem, namely that of police targeting of black youth.  Now that he's so strongly associated with that problem, it seems like people don't want to admit that perhaps Brown did at least reasonably seem to pose a threat because it would feel like they're betraying a cause they care a lot about, even if to admit that would be the more reasonable position to take.\\n\\nChange my view.\"},\n {'title': 'CMV: If you regularly spend money on cigarettes, alcohol, or other types of drugs while you are financially struggling, you are an irresponsible person.',\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2nbz5b',\n  'selftext': \"Normally my politics are extremely left leaning, and I always give struggling people the benefit of the doubt. \\n\\nHowever, my sympathy is harshly reduced when someone takes an already limited budget and sets aside money for food, drugs, or tobacco products. \\n\\n**Note** the occasional expenditure on a vice is not a problem.

There seems to be two main reasons behind this:\\n\\n1.) We shouldn't teach kids to behave well in order to get things.\\n\\n2.) Lying to them about Santa will cause trust issues later in life.\\n\\nNeither of these are good reasons. Legends of Santa or a Santa-like figure have existed for centuries and they haven't brought about any sort of social issues. The idea of Santa isn't teaching children that the only reason to be good is to get something, it's simply a fun idea for Christmas. Kids don't suddenly become malevolent people once they find out that Santa didn't deliver those presents. And regardless of that, in real life, doing good things *does* often result in rewards, so it's not as though the idea is false.\\n\\nThe, imo, more ridiculous issue is that children will fall into some sort of existential crisis when they find out Santa isn't real. I've never met anyone who has suddenly developed trust issues after they found out. Most kids seem to just get over it after like an hour. If there is a child for whom the discovery of the truth behind Santa leads to trust issues or trauma, then that child hasn't developed a healthy sense of reasoning, and if something as insignificant as Santa would be enough to push them into mental issues, then they will inevitably be faced by far worse examples of lying later on that will take a more extreme toll. It's not the idea of Santa, it's the individual and their ability to understand basic social norms and customs. \\n\\nAs said before, Santa is an idea that's been around for ages. It's never caused any problems before and while people have every right to not teach their kids about him, doing so in order to protect them is frankly juvenile and unnecessary. By doing so they are denying their children a fun and harmless tradition that makes Christmas an amazing time for millions of other across the world.\\n\\n**TL;DR** Santa is harmless and all those claiming that the idea that he's harmful are being oversensitive.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n**EDIT** I have read all the comments, and the only reason that I haven't replied to all is because for some I would be repeating myself and because some comments just seemed to be oddly passive-aggressive, considering that this place is meant to change views and not try to subtly insult people. *But* anyway, I'm going to CMV because even though I still believe that the story of Santa is inherently harmless and that the accusations of it being bad are exaggerated, a few users have commented on how it *can* potentially be harmful. Namely, some parents could use it as a form of blackmail. I personally think that any parent who does this is a shitty parent, and it has more to do with them than the idea of Santa itself (I've never felt threatened or blackmailed, so it's not necessary). However, my OP was saying that it's completely harmless, and I can see how it can be used in a horrible way, so the level of harm that the Santa lie can create is fairly dependant on the parents/those implementing it.\"},\n {'title': 'CMV: Americans should be more accepting of British pronunciation',\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2n9vx2',\n  'selftext': 'I was born in America but, due to my mother being Australian, pronounce certain words differently.

Also, only for absolutely heinous crimes like murder.\\n\\nI believe that everyone of us that lives in a society has tacitly agreed to a social contract and to abide by the society's laws. By committing a crime like murder, this contract is broken and the individual has given up the right to live in that particular society. As such, the death penalty seems like the only way to remove the murderer from society and prevent him from threatening the safety of others. Exile seems like an option too, but it is quite clearly no longer a realistic option in today's globalised and interconnected world. \\n\\nI have read certain arguments saying that the state does not have the right to take another person's life. However, I believe that the state does in fact have this right, since the person has broken the social contract and the state has the duty to protect the safety of others in society. Also, since we have already conceded that the state has the right to restrict the freedom of individuals by putting them in prisons when they commit a crime, I don't see how it is much more of a stretch to say that they similarly have the right to take another person's life when they commit a much more heinous crime.\\n\\nAlso, while I generally support rehabilitation, I think that it is only appropriate for lesser crimes like drug abuse or assault. A murderer will cause a much bigger threat to society (even after having undergone rehabilitation, there is no guarantee that the individual will not murder again) and I do not think that others that live in the society deserve to be put under this threat.\\n\\nHence, these are the main reasons why I am in favour of the death penalty. Of course, I am assuming that the accused is mentally sound to make the choice of committing the crime.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Ie libertarians who support laissez-fair capitalism and private property.\\n\\nTo my understanding, Libertarians advocate a society where all interactions take place based on voluntary, mutual agreements.\\n\\nI am not going to argue the merit of that ideology itself (in fact I think it is fine). Instead, I want to argue that the free markets, advocated by most libertarians (and most notably, libertarian CEOs) would create a situation that they *themselves* would think of as \"unfair\".\\n\\nHere\\'s the main argument against free markets: while companies are no longer constrained by (often inefficient) government rules, it allows for so-called \"slave wages\" and \"private corporate tyranny\", meaning that CEOs will have their employees working for the bare, absolute minimum.\\n\\n\"Nonsense,\" most Libertarians will say. \"A voluntary agreement can\\'t be slavery. People have the choice to deny the job we offer.\"\\n\\nWhich is correct. But also a bit naive. People are prepared to work very hard for very little. Corporations know this, and it would be very difficult indeed to find a job *anywhere* where the employer would be kind enough to provide more than the bare minimum. Yes, it will be voluntary. But will that make it any less cruel?\\n\\nBut that\\'s not my problem with libertarianism. (seeing as you can argue that the benefits will outway the costs, people will somehow unanimously refuse the lowest wages, etc.) **My main point is that Libertarianism is contradictory.** And here\\'s why: the government is, fundamentally, no different from a corporation providing services. Only here, the services are police forces, roads, health care, and all in all, *society itself.* (There is only one real difference, and that is that in a democratic government, citizens can elect their \"CEOs\")\\n\\nIf you, as a CEO, don\\'t like the rules and taxes the government asks in return for allowing you to use its services, you should just move your corporation to a different country. Or start your own. But of course you won\\'t do that, because you lack the resources, or because you *need* the benefits of your country for keeping your corporation alive. Why, it\\'s not a choice at all! \\n\\nWell, welcome to the situation of a labourer faced with a free market. You have a choice. Kind of. Only it\\'s not a choice at all. \\n\\nIf you truly consider this sort of \"voluntary\" interaction fair, then you must also accept that you have no right to complain about the current status quo. And if you think it is \"unfair\", then you necessarily also deem the basics of a free market itself \"unfair\". Therein, I think, lies the contradiction of Libertarianism.

They can also be harmful. Humans are better off not existing.',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2n84wy',\n  'selftext': 'I came to this conclusion by thinking about these questions: \\n\\n*What is the worth of life?* -Life cannot actually be valued. It is not priceless, nor is it worthless. It is simply something that is and isn\\'t. \\n\\n*What is the worth of a human?* -At one time, the human species had value just as much as the other life forms on earth. Over the next couple thousand years, we have done horrible damage to our one reliable resource. I cannot in good conscience value human life.\\n\\n*What is the worth of society?* -Society is like the fly population. It serves a very vital purpose in how what we know is structured, but can it please just take a day off or something? The most ignorant and horrible things ever done in the history of mankind were done because a group of people with certain beliefs agreed on something (ie: the KKK, holocaust, 9/11). Society is a petri dish where humans can grow in a biased environment. Society is also something that cannot be valued, but for different reasons. The urge to be around others of your own kind exists everywhere, and this cannot be blamed for the barbaric acts that arise from humans following the instinct.\\n\\n*Why do people have power that isn\\'t physical?* -Society is the answer to this. Having 100 people on your side would usually make the other 10 fall right into line. There are outliers as shown all across history, but the pattern exists for a reason.\\n\\n*Why has the world degenerated so much?* -Because of humans. We all(arguable) want to improve the standard of living of ourselves and those we look favorable toward, also known as our \"loved ones\".\\n\\n*How does all of this tie together?* -People look after their own due to the attachments they develop. This would cause you to rush to the defense of those you form attachments to. In this way, we have those who \"serve and protect\" because of their abstract attachment such as loyalty to a country, society, or government system. Morals are just people agreeing that certain things are right and certain things are wrong. If you do not conform to such a view, you are bombarded with disapproval and peer pressure until you approve, are somewhere you cannot impact society from, or are dead. Humans are flawed so our morals and values must also be flawed on some level.\\n\\n*Where is the danger?* -Mommy only knows best when you\\'re mommy. Otherwise, she is just trying to impose her ideas and worldview on you. This attitude is the biggest cause of conflicts throughout human history. We just can\\'t *trust* one another! And for good reason, too. Humans just cannot be trusted, especially by other humans. So what\\'s the next best thing? Conformity. Peer pressure. Social norms. Playing to your instincts. You will defend what you want while the other team will defend what they want and both of you will look like idiots afterwards because you will finally see that your motivations are one and the same. *You* are the same as *them*. There is no us and them because we are all exactly the same. Does that perspective make every single altercation in the history of mankind look completely and utterly moronic to anyone else? Forget sacrifice. Forget selflessness. Forget duty. Forget necessity. Forget greed. Forget quarrel. Forget *love*! Every single altercation between two humans, no matter what it was over, looks so laughably primitive to me that I find myself wishing that I had never been concieved.\\n\\nChange my view, Reddit.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There is nothing to feel bad about if someone feels this way about you either. \\n\\nIt seems to me that women are told to perceive this as an offense. For instance if a stranger approached me and said \"hey, I find you very attractive, want to have sex?\" being very insulted would seem like an appropriate reaction for me. I don\\'t think that makes any sense at all. \\n\\n\\nThis can be a problem though, depending on the circumstance, so of course context plays a role. Some main examples of when this is a problem:\\n\\na) there is a reasonable expectation that the person in question should be interested in you for something else. If your mentor in the university or your employer or your parent or your doctor is only interested in you for sex, I don\\'t have to explain why this would be a huge problem.\\n\\nb) the person interested in you for sex is being pushy about it and doesn\\'t accept that you aren\\'t interested. Of course you don\\'t have to share that interest and they should then let it go.\\n\\nc) the person is attempting to get closer to you by deliberately pretenting they are interested in something else, thereby creating the situation a). For instance, someone acting like they want to hire you because you are very capable and then it turns out they just wanted you to have sex with them.\\n\\nd) the person expresses their interest in an obviously inappropriate time and situation. Like, on a funeral or in the middle of your date with your so.\\n\\nBut these don\\'t affect my view because my view only deals with the insult coming from the fact a person is only interested in sexual part of you. similar examples can be used for any number of things and stem from some form of inappropriateness and not sex itself.\\n\\nOther than that, the idea that there are some people who see you and don\\'t care about anything more from you than the possibility of sex isn\\'t anything to feel angry about. If they weren\\'t physically attracted to you they would likely not be interested at all, so it isn\\'t like their interest in sex is taking away from potentally more meaningful relationship (in fact if they would be interested in something else as well, but are also interested in sex, one doesn\\'t take from the other.)\\n\\nOnce back when I was in school we watched a video in psychology where a guy approached about 20 different women asking them if they want sex with him (he was actually attractive, maybe 8) and they all declined and most of them were pretty angry. Then a woman (imo, less attractive than a guy but it doesn\\'t matter) approached about 20 men. Not only did the most agree, but those who didn\\'t were very polite about it \"oh, Im sorry but I am married, thanks for asking\" and similar answers. Very shocking difference in responses. I am not interested in the part where some declined and some accepted, but rather in the way they took it. For men it was always a compliment, for women, almost always (some did find it funny) an offense.\\n\\nAlso when that catcalling video was posted and on many discussions after, girls pointed out how it is offensive to know that someoen is only interested in your body and approaching you for sex. Many people defended what happened saying that sometimes you start small talk or greet a stranger without wanting sex, and that is perfectly fine, but my question is, even if someone shows interest in you only because of attraction and some hope for sex, shouldn\\'t the only appropriate response be politely declining if you aren\\'t interested? Or even if you just don\\'t respond at all, like you wouldn\\'t every time someoen is trying to sell something to you from the street, it still shouldn\\'t warrant personal offense. I also noticed that when women tried to explain to men why catcalling botheres them so much and asked them to imagine a role reversal in the video, most men couldn\\'t understand why they should feel bad about many women trying to chat them up.\\n\\n\\nThe deeper issue with this is that I think it promotes much deeper insecurity in women. Why can most men accept the idea of being objectified and not have it be important, perhaps just a nice compliment. And when it happens to women it becomes a huge issue, it becomes about someone taking away from your very humanity, reducing you to an object etc. \\n\\nWhy would I think a stranger or acquaitance has such power over me that the mere fact they only care about my body reduces me to anything objectively? Why would I not feel enough basic confidence in the fact that I am a person (a very small thing to feel confident about) that this becomes only a compliment of one of my attributes?\\n\\nI am not sure if i am articulating this second part well, but it is something that has been bothering me for a while. I just think it would be much healthier if a non threatening expression of purely sexual interest isn\\'t treated like anything negative - because it isn\\'t negative. It\\'s neutral to positive, depending on what you take from it.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: I just want to include this part of my response from the comments because I think it is relevant to what I was trying to say in the second part.\\n\\nThe huge problem here for me is the assumption that somebody being interested in one specific thing from you (which let\\'s face it is the case in most human interactions unless with people close to us, and only seen as an issue when its this specific case) actually has the power to take away your complexity. It propagates the idea that being interested in your body takes the value off other things about you in general. It promotes almost pathological and irrational insecurity and a weird need for affirmation from men. Which is ironic. **The whole time same mentality keeps telling women that we aren\\'t doing things for male validation, especially with looks - and then it ends up saying that if the man happens to only validate your looks he is insulting you since he failed to validate the other parts.**'},\n {'title': 'CMV:There is no good reason to have children \"of your own\".',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2n54g8',\n  'selftext': \"My view is that there is no compelling reason (moral or otherwise) to have children that are genetically related to you, and that there are a lot of good reasons not to.\\n\\nIf you're in a developed country (and probability is that you are) then every new person contributes to anthropogenic climate change.

I think this is generally bad advice: not because I think that *no one* should go into the skilled trades, but because 1.) I think most people aren't cut out for a trade career, and 2.) the stable income one can earn as a skilled tradesman is maintained by the scarcity of skilled tradesmen. To expand:\\n\\n**Skilled trade jobs are hard, physical work**: I come from a family of roofers, and live in an area that has been experiencing constant new home construction since the early '90s. My father was a satellite TV installer back when a satellite dish would take up most of your back yard, and a TV/telephone installer after that. Most of my (older) family members have had major knee, back, and hip surgeries in their 40s and 50s, and many have sustained life-altering or career-ending injuries. Physically, I would *never* have been able to pursue a career in the 'family business' (I'm a skinny dude), and I think it's better to work 40 years and retire with your body mostly intact than work 25-30 years and retire because you've destroyed your body and physically can't work any more. \\n\\n**It's going to be a long time (possibly never) until skilled trades are 'respected'**. I'm sure many people don't care how society views their career, and would laugh in the face of someone who denigrates their job while making substantially less money. That said: there will always be *some* people who look down on the 'dirty jobs', and some people who avoid those jobs because of it. I don't think income level alone will be enough to legitimize certain careers at certain levels of society. I'm not saying it's right: I'm saying it's a reality. Some people will always balk at marrying a sewage technician, even if that sewage technician is making +$100k.\\n\\n**(The Big One) The only reason the skilled trades are well-paid is because they are scarce**. We will always need contractors, plumbers, electricians, and welders; but we only need so many. In the '70s, everyone was advising young people to go into medicine. In the '80s, everyone was advising young people to go into law. In the '90s, everyone was advising young people to go into technology and computers. Look at the job prospects of those fields today. Medicine is still well-paid, but only because it takes a decade (and hundreds of thousands of dollars) to become a doctor. Starting lawyers are earning ~$40k, after accruing +$100k in law school debt. Information Technology grads have a higher unemployment rate than Theater or English majors. **Any field that experiences a rapid influx of credentialed professionals suffers from depressed wages and high unemployment.** If young people take the oft-proffered advice and enter the skilled trades: their experience is going to be worse. It takes much less time, money, and (please don't be mad at me for saying so) intellectual rigor to become certified as a skilled tradesman than it does to become a doctor, lawyer, or computer scientist. By the same token ...\\n\\n**Wages and working conditions in the skilled trades have been protected by unionization, which is ever-diminishing**. The trajectory of unions in the US has been sad and getting sadder for decades. Unions are the weakest today that they've been since before the Gilded Age. An influx of newly credentialed tradesmen, desperate for work in an increasingly saturated market, will lead to fewer union-affiliated workers. As union membership decreases, wages will fall. With Right-to-Work laws in a majority of US states, unions will lose power and skilled trade jobs will go to the lowest bidders - skilled trades will no longer provide a middle-class income. \\n\\n**A college degree is still a worthwhile investment**. Statistically, a college degree is worth somewhere between $800k to $1.2m over the course of a working career. Even if a student takes out $32k in loans (the average for a college graduate), that investment returns many, many times over the course of a career. An investment that provides a very real monetary return while affording the graduate a less physically-demanding career with greater social recognition seems like a good investment to me. \\n\\nToday, as it stands, few people enter the skilled trades because they are physically difficult and because they don't garner the level of social respect that the so-called 'white collar' careers attain. For the people who still choose the skilled trades - this is good news. It means that their wages are better and they can use their scarcity of labor to control their pay and working conditions. Further, it means that young people who are inherently suited for the skilled trades (because of family background, physical prowess, and/or difficulty with traditional education) have the opportunity to earn a comfortable living in a skilled trade. Encouraging many people who wouldn't have considered entering the skilled trades on their own volition to make that choice will depress wages and discourage those who could have earned a university degree (which would have been a better investment) to enter a lower-paying and more physically-destructive career. \\n\\nSkilled tradesmen are benefitting from the scarcity of employees in their fields. Let's allow them to keep that scarcity, encourage those who can excel in college to pursue a degree, and encourage everyone to pursue the field that best suits their abilities: not the one that will earn the most money. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We have recently been reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. For those who have not read it or know only general plot points, the book satirizes white, southern society in pre-civil war America, pointing out the contradictions accepted as fact by many of the whites of the era. \\n\\nDuring our reading of Huck Finn, we have been given 2 quizzes, the first covering chapters 1-15 and the second covering chapters 16-31. The quizzes are essentially split between fact-based questions on plot points and critical-reading-based questions that require an argument supported with evidence. I\\'m angry right now (after having taken the 2^nd quiz earlier today) because the fact-based questions seem to be designed to be difficult, and only focus on unimportant and minute details. This type of question also accounted for half of the possible points on each quiz.\\n\\nOn the first quiz, there was a section that required you to match characters with their descriptions. Rather than describe the characters in terms of their role in the book, or what they represent in their society, the questions described the characters in reference to another character, in the context of an unimportant event in the book. For example, Jim, the second most important character in the book behind Huck himself, is a runaway slave that travels with Huck throughout the book. Rather than describe him as that, his description was *\"has his hat hung on a tree by Tom Sawyer.\"* While that is an accurate description of Jim, the event described does not serve any important purpose to the book. \\n\\nSimilarly, the second quiz featured 8 fact-based, short answer questions, 6 of which had to be answered. Number 6 asked, *\"how does the King justify his incorrect use of the word obsequies?\"* Again, this small detail does not hold any real significance in the book. My teacher has justified this type of detail-oriented question before, claiming that she wants to reward the kids that read the book for reading the book. However, having read the book myself, and having taken notes and read online guides to further clarify the book, I still could not answer this question, because as I was reading I figured that such a small detail couldn\\'t possibly matter enough to write down. \\n\\nThe questions that focus on what Twain was really saying with Huck Finn such as *\"What is Twain satirizing with the character of Doctor Robinson?\"* are weighted equally with the previously mentioned questions. Thus, a student that comes away from the book not remembering any details and only knowing the metaphors and satirical elements Twain creates (which is the only part of Huck Finn that really matters) would have gotten a 50% on the test. The county I live in has a \"50% rule\", which allows students to automatically get half-credit on anything for attempting it. Thus, students that understand the book perfectly and students that didn\\'t read it at all receive the same grade on the quizzes in my class. **This is why I\\'m angry: by focusing on what actually matters when reading Huck Finn, my teacher is essentially telling me I might as well have not read the book at all.** \\n\\nChange my view, before I complain to my teacher.

I\\'ve attempted to fool around and with 5 different women. 5 very different women. They all rejected me because my penis too small. Some didn\\'t say so but I knew. Always pulling the fade on me after sex.I learned from my mistakes in my first encounter and started learning about oral and fingering as if I was going to be graded on it. It worked in getting her off but even then the aesthetic of a small penis is a mood killer apparently. They always made this face of disappointment whenever I pulled my pants down. They always act so bored when they fucked me.  If you want to know my full experience you can read it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25mirp/size_does_matter/). It\\'s depressing but read at your own risk. I can\\'t even read it myself. \\n\\nI hold this view is because from my experiences and other people\\'s experiences, with people of the same size and smaller, women can be cruel even if unintentionally. There are many more stories from other people which I will be happy to find for you. It\\'s always the same story. Rejection ,cheating.\"settling\", and an open relationship. Some people have suggested that I force myself into small penis humiliation fetish and a cuckold fetish. It just further proves that people don\\'t think I\\'m man enough to be with a woman. \\n\\nWhile some women don\\'t apparently care about size (which really translates to average is fine, but bigger is better) , it still sucks to know that my penis does nothing for her. My penis is apart of me and makes me what I am, and when I hear someone say \"you don\\'t need a dick to satisfy\" they simply do not get the full picture. I\\'d like to know that my penis feels good for someone. My favorite is the \"lesbians get off without penises, you\\'re fine\". I can\\'t help but think those people are idiots.\\n\\nSome women say they prefer smaller. When I ask what that means they usually say 5\"-6\". I can\\'t help but laugh at those responses. It\\'s either you\\'re huge or small. I happen to be very small. Some even say girth matters more. That does absolutely nothing for most people who face my problems. Most small dicks are proportionate. I\\'m fucked with 4\" length and 4.5\" girth. \\n\\nI think the equivalent to \"size does not matter\" would be telling a girl that you\\'re with her for her personality and not for her looks despite her knowing that she\\'s unattractive. It\\'s just not the same. Or for instance when people suggest a penis sheath (penis extender) it\\'s the equivalent of putting a mask over a woman\\'s face because it makes sex better for the guy since the woman\\'s face on it\\'s own won\\'t cut it. As a woman I would feel insulted. \\n\\nYou should all know about the stigma of small dicks in media. How those men are perceived less as a man and as more pathetic. How all porn is about big dicks while the smaller ones are about humiliation. How women have a fetishes for a big dicks and actually sleep with someone based on the notion that a guy is hung. How having a small dick is used as an insult and a dealbreaker.\\n\\nSome of you might be thinking this is me being bitter and misogynistic, but all of this accumulated from my experiences, dozens of other people\\'s experiences. and media. I\\'ve been trying to find an answer to all of this for almost 7 years of my life. The answer is always the same. The overwhelming majority of women would rather have a guy who\\'s average sized or bigger than a smaller than average.  \\n\\nI doubt you could change my view, but if you could you would change my life and many others.

It’s the law. According to law, a man must register with Selective Service within 30 days of his 18th birthday.

You may be denied benefits or a job if you have not registered.\\n\\n[On Their FAQ](https://www.sss.gov/QA.HTM#quest1)\\n&gt;What is Selective Service registration?\\nRegistration is a way our government keeps a list of names of men from which to draw in case of a national emergency requiring rapid expansion of our Armed Forces.

The actual art style of the comic is usually very repetitive and plain. Most of the art consists of the characters talking to each other in front of sparse backgrounds such as walking, the pitching mound, Lucy\\'s psychiatric stand, or the pumpkin patch. Rarely do the animations depict any interesting action, and they are usually interchangeable between days. \\n\\n2. The comic\\'s comedy or sentimental value is also objectively low. Rarely is a strip something that elicits even a smile, let alone some sort of profound emotion. Instead we read to see beloved characters acting out some one-note plot over four frames. \\n\\n3.

The spirit of Thanksgiving fits into the Christmas season perfectly.  For me at least, Thanksgiving is about taking the time to sit down and share a meal with your loved ones and to give thanks for and acknowledge all your blessings (including and especially said loved ones).  The Christmas season is about love, cheer, family, and goodwill.  Are these two mutually exclusive?  Absolutely not. \\n\\n\\n2. Christmas is certainly a “season.”  With the decorations *everywhere*, the colorful lights, the holiday treats, the endless commercials, the songs on the radio, and the yearly stream of Christmas movies, Christmas is undeniably a *season*.  Thanksgiving is a weekend.  Thanksgiving, as it exists today, is from Wednesday until Sunday (at most), and it consists of family, food, and football.  Two weeks before Christmas, it feels like Christmas.  Three *days* before Thanksgiving, it doesn’t feel like Thanksgiving.  So it’s not like the Christmas season would be infringing on the “season” of another holiday (Sidenote: Halloween is *definitely* a season to me, as I listen to Halloween-y songs and watch appropriately-themed movies for the two weeks leading up to Halloween.  I recommend you do the same.  Christmas can stay the hell away from Halloween).\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd to the New Yorkers who say that Santa’s appearance at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade signals the start of the Christmas season, my response is that that is just as arbitrary as anything else starting the Christmas season.   You can put up decorations and listen to Christmas music in mid-November and still have Santa appear at the parade.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Ebenezer Scrooge says in A Christmas Carol, “I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all year.”  I see nothing wrong with a period of cheer and goodwill extending a couple of weeks into November (especially if it’s a particularly snowy November; it feels wrong to not be listening to “Baby It’s Cold Outside” or “Let It Snow” when 8 feet fall in Buffalo just because Thanksgiving hasn’t happened yet).\\n\\nChange my view!\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This is undeniable. The data shows that the surface temperate has steadily increased, so let\\'s first establish that we can\\'t just ignore data. Sure, the severity of global warming can be argued, but again, the first portion of my title, \"Global warming in undeniably happening\" simply means the steadily increasing temperature, and I am in no way stating specific causes of global warming. \\n\\nSecondly, we\\'re going to focus on the United States. You may bring up other countries in my argument, but my argument will be based on where I reside. Again, it will be an extremely long argument if every single Country or region is involved. And my justification for leaving these areas out are because obviously areas such as Africa, for example, will generally be more negatively affected, however, they\\'re already struggling. There\\'s a lot of poor areas, especially also near coasts, that could potentially be screwed over. Just looking at the [opinions by country](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country), we can quickly see that a lot of these areas care less and are unaware of the issue. Then there\\'s the fact that the amount of effort and money it would take to really reduce global warming could easily also be invested in solving already-occurring problems and save even more lives than potentially lost from global warming. And then there\\'s the fact that the countries that can actually cause us to lean towards one path or the other are most likely those that will not be affected extremely negatively and everyone else is expendable. In addition, since they can\\'t do anything about it, they are just spectators. So I believe that focusing my argument on just the United States will allow for simplicity, is fairly accurate since the United States will be the main deciding factor on what will be done, and also since most redditors live in the United States it will be a more accurate argument. Feel free to also apply this argument to areas similar to the United States and do the math yourself if you\\'re interested.\\n\\n\\nBy 2100:\\nIt\\'s either controlled (-1 to 0 change) or there\\'s a 5 degree celsius change (highest)\\n\\nHere\\'s an interesting medium-to-worst case scenario [chart](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/figure-spm-2.html) and the website also has good global warming facts leaning toward we\\'re fucked so let\\'s go with that for a second.\\n\\n**Melting Ice**\\nIce will melt, sea levels will rise. Global warming could then increase, and worst-case scenario we\\'re left with a substantial increase in water levels. People will be forced to move; I do not believe people will die since it\\'s very gradual. Even in the worst scenario, this would just mean that those who live in more expensive areas (New York, Los Angeles) will have to move. If it\\'s very severe I\\'m sure the government will handle it, however, assuming everyone is on their own, most of the coastal areas are owned and occupied by the rich, so they will be able to move easily. As for droughts, levels have been fluctuating at an inconsistent rate and even if there are droughts there always have been and they can be managed. And going back to moving: people can move to cheaper areas. It will be positive for the majority as even if it ends up being a large change in their life, it will be for the better with decreased living costs. Small added bonus: once it all melts, less ice everywhere so safer for ships.\\n\\n**Increasing Temperatures in General**\\nDo more people die during the summer or winter in the US? The latter. Increasing winter temperatures means less pneumonia and less deaths in the winter. And at the very most temperatures will increase by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit which is manageable. And adding on to migration: there will be less rain in the south, more everywhere else. So it\\'s all a shift toward the center. Less snow, more rain. Warmer nights. Most livestock losses will be in Texas but there\\'s plenty of other areas higher up north that this can be shifted into. Tourism will increase and the general \\'enjoyability\\' of the weather on average throughout the year will be higher and closer to areas often visited during vacations. Pollen is increased so it sucks for people will allergies but guess what more pollen means? \\n\\n**Carbon Dioxide Levels**\\nThis is what is argued to cause the increased rate of global warming. What do plants like? Yep. So assuming that droughts won\\'t be extremely severe, which even at the worst case scenario wouldn\\'t wipe out all our crops, especially since we have irrigation, it will actually be an extremely positive effect. Especially with genetically engineered crops, I\\'m sure this can be taken advantage of and any possible negative effects reduced. If not, worst case scenario it\\'ll be about the same. This will however also hurt livestock since the nutrients in plants will change, but this is assuming we haven\\'t been basically turning livestock into genetic Frankeinsteins and also assuming natural selection doesn\\'t occur. \\n\\n**Year 2100 Conclusion**\\nNow of course a lot of what I said is assuming the \"worst\" or highest climate change. Odds are that it will be somewhere in the middle. Especially with us just noticing what\\'s going on and plans to shift away and towards a more eco-friendly world, I assume global warming will be at a rate somewhere between 2-3 degrees in the next 100 years. So honestly, this will take away a lot of the super-extreme negatives and just change it enough to where the positives shine. Change isn\\'t always bad. We can adapt, especially with the technology we have and we can use a lot of these changes to our benefit very easily. At the very worst it\\'ll be negligible and at the best it will be beneficial. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Let\\'s take a look into the future...**\\nSome extreme cases say that this will occur until the year 3000. So what happens then? Well, the Antarctica ice sheets will be melting... wait, they won\\'t be gone by the year 3000? Nope. Then there\\'s the possibility of having another mini-ice age that will counter-act some of this. And the figure I gave you earlier? Well, actually it turns out that by the year 2100 we\\'ll most likely have a maximum of about 4 degrees or less increase and that\\'s on the high end of the spectrum. Then by the year 3000 we would have the 5 degree change, maybe. Now if you add in all the random fluctuations, all the possibilities for other things completely out of our control affecting global warming, everything becomes very minimal. Again, even in the worst cases most scientists agree that everything will reach an equilibrium by the year 3000. That\\'s the year 3000... and of course until then just knowing about global warming has already caused most of the world\\'s people want something done about it and there things being done. If you see this as a positive thing, then guess what? Global warming caused it. Now, if you see it as negative, then that means you most likely think that global warming isn\\'t a big deal and we\\'re just wasting effort and money, in which case that\\'s still a positive because global warming is happening so I think we\\'re at the perfect level of doing and/or not doing anything about it and either way we have a bright future ahead of us.\\n'},\n {'title': 'CMV: I believe society causes more trauma for rape victims',\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2mv3n4',\n  'selftext': \"This is something I noticed after seeing the huge amount of discussion about rape on reddit.

It's most obvious in cases where female teachers have sex with younger boys and peoples reaction to it (mostly) is 'NOICCE' or 'I wish this happened to me, my teacher was hot'. Then when it happens with the sexes reversed the reaction is mostly, 'That disgusting pedo deserves to get anally raped in jail' and 'Oh that poor girl, a terrible thing has been done to her'.\\n\\nAs a result of this, you come across a lot of men who have been technically raped but who simply get over it extremely quickly despite feeling dirty, violated etc as other guys around them just say stuff like 'You got laid dude quit complaining'. Essentially, society acts to minimise those bad feelings, allowing the man to move on quickly.\\n\\nHowever, when a woman gets raped, society's reaction amplifies these bad feelings to make the woman feel even worse. Society makes women feel they are now damaged, and a mark has been burned on them forever. This kind of thing is obvious in cases where a woman who initially thought a sexual encounter was just uncomfortable is now told she was raped. Society's general reaction to rape would only make the woman feel even worse about it, and not let her move on for a much longer time than for a man.\\n\\nI am not saying if I think either reaction is right or wrong, but it seems to be that way. So CMV, does society make female rape victims feel worse about it then they would otherwise?\\n\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\"},\n {'title': \"CMV: There's no argument against the Keystone XL Pipeline besides Imminent Domain being used to build it.\",\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2muqkt',\n  'selftext': \"I see no reason that the KXL should be so hated, besides the (in my opinion unjust, but that's a topic for another CMV) practice of Imminent Domain being used.

I\\'m not sure anyone has actually convinced me to change my view thus far, though you\\'ve done well at arguing that what I\\'m talking about can\\'t happen/is not a good idea for me to try/it\\'s been shown that such an idea can\\'t work. I think it\\'s fair to say that a number of you convinced me that I\\'m being unrealistic and that I should just suck it up because any alternative in the vein of what I\\'m describing is going to be much worse. In other words, you\\'ve gotten me to agree at the practical level, but no one has yet convinced me at the theoretical level, though some of you have tried to argue that my question is flawed, and that the law of being a part of a social system is literally inviolable, like laws of physics, which I\\'m afraid I don\\'t buy.**\\n\\nTo start, let me state that I\\'m not a libertarian, and I identify fairly strongly as a liberal. I also do not identify with any militia or secessionist movements, and I\\'m not anti-government per se. However, I am increasingly dissatisfied with society and the rules of society that I am bound to. I\\'m unhappy with our collective cultural values, the demands of the global economy, and of capitalism in general. All of this has led to to this series of thoughts.\\n\\nThere is much discussion on the topic of privacy relating to \"the right to be left alone.\" To me, that\\'s just the right to not be annoyed. But let\\'s talk about the right to be completely left alone-- the right to not deal with society at all, ever. In other words, do we, as humans, have the right from birth to not participate or be beholden to any social/national/economic/legal structure, AND the right to realistically act on that? I believe the answer is YES, and any answer other than YES, at least in the current state of the world, is basically an endorsement of human rights violations. Here is why.\\n\\nI was never asked to join this planet, nor was I asked which of many options of nationality to choose from (in fact, as a fully grown adult, I still can\\'t freely choose this). I wasn\\'t even asked whether I wanted to be a part of-- and thus tacitly approve of -- the whole nation-state structure that has been established. As it stands, I have no option but to agree to participate in the idea of nations, laws, global economies, currency, etc., which I am essentially coerced into doing by legal penalty, no matter where in the world I am. This is true because every habitable place on this planet has been claimed as \"property\" within the jurisdiction of some social structure, leaving me no place to physically inhabit without being subjected to another\\'s rules/society/economy-- none of which I have any desire to participate in. I can on some practical level, opt out and live \"illegally\" on some land somewhere out of sight, but this cannot come with full peace of mind, as there will always be some looming threat of legal consequence to failure to comply with the laws of the territory I am living in (e.g. trespassing). \\n\\nBut wait, you might say, there\\'s a workaround. You can buy a small piece of land and live there in isolation without ever dealing with society. But I don\\'t think so. First of all, I have to participate in some economy I don\\'t believe in before I can even buy that land. This means that I have to get a job, get a car, do all the things that make us all miserable, and participate in an economy I never asked to be a part of just so I can opt out! Then after that, I would have to pay property taxes on that land every year. Thus, I am continually forced back into participating in an economy that I want no part in just to pay for the land that I need to escape it. The way I read this is that even the \"workaround\" to the essential problem posed in the previous paragraph forces me to participate in all these systems before I can even exercise the right to leave, and then once I do exercise my right to leave, the structures still force me to be bound to it. In other words, I have no viable means of escape.  \\n\\n...which means that I am a slave, and my human rights are being continually violated.

Finally, it doesn't improve the black condition.\",\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2mqzo8',\n  'selftext': 'While I know this is a popular topic, I feel that I have specific points in my argument that have not been addressed before.\\n\\nFull disclosure: I am an Asian living in a high income white town, [Glastonbury, CT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury,_Connecticut) In addition, as a high performing student, I am directly affected by Affirmative Action. In my defense, I would point out that a black/hispanic on the other side would be just as affected. With this argument, everyone has a bias and an agenda. \\n\\nFirst the facts:\\n [SAT Scores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Bias_against_Asians_and_whites) (Note: while this is in the criticism sections, please only look at the data and not the editorial comments, as to get a non-biased outlook)\\n\\n[Black graduation](http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) (Note: as this is called the \"Black Journal of Higher Education\", I trust that no one will call me out on using a source that favors my case)\\n\\n       1. Let\\'s address my last claim first: It doesn\\'t improve the \"black condition\" and is unnecessary for the vast majority of blacks/hispanics\\n\\n-This idea is supposed to \"level the playing field\" with all races. All this actually does is passes deserving and intelligent Whites and Asians over for less intelligent and undeserving people in an environment they can\\'t succeed in. For example, [black graduation rates are much lower than white graduation rates.] (http://www.jbhe.com/features/50_blackstudent_gradrates.html) The difference reaches up to +20 points, which is clearly not equality. This disparity is due to affirmative action putting incompetent and undeserving Blacks and Hispanics in college. However, I must make an important clarification. I believe that the vast majority of blacks can succeed in college, and have done so. Affirmative action is not necessary for these kinds of people. The only people affirmative action helps are those who wouldn\\'t be able to get into college otherwise, and by getting them into college, they will only have false expectations and ultimately perform poorly when they realize that college grading is color blind. This is the idea of [mismatching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action#Mismatching) and has been backed up by research. \\n\\n          2. Affirmative action unfairly favors blacks/hispanics over Asians, and thus is racist towards Asians. \\n\\n-Ok, you make the argument that this favoritism towards blacks/hispanics is simply reparations for past transgressions, Jim Crow and the low. Well, Asians have been heavily discriminated against in the past. Jap interment, railroad building, and racial slurs and stereotypes have all been a part of Asian-American history. In fact, I\\'d argue that hispanics have been least discriminated in US history. [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States#Asian_Americans) From this, if you believe that AA is \"payback\" for past actions, defend the favoring of blacks over Asian Americans.\\n\\n           3. Affirmative action is a result of blacks/hispanics that just want to favor their own race. \\n\\nNote: I must admit, for this I have no direct proof, only my anecdotal experience and statements made by others.\\n\\n-Blacks/Hispanics have more political power in this country than Asians, in both positions of government and constituents in voting. Therefore, I believe AA is simply a way to get the black vote/blacks helping out each other. Obviously, being against this political suicide and will get the racist tag labeled in a second. Clarence Thomas, as he is unaffected by these factors as he is appointed and he is black (this is a big factor, a white Justice would get labeled racist), is able to speak out and say that affirmative action is indeed racist, not only towards other races, but blacks themselves. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas#Equal_protection_and_affirmative_action)\\n\\n\\nThis is my case. While I do admit I believe very strongly in my position, I would point out that I have remained civil in my point, provided sources, and made full disclosure in my situation and any opinions not directly proven by facts. Most importantly, I recognize that I am heavily influenced by this topic, and thus may be blinded. I hope we can have a civil discourse.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is practiced through \\'positive buying\\' in that ethical products are favored, or \\'moral boycott\\', that is negative purchasing and company-based purchasing.\\n\\nIn practice, we can view something like \"Green sourcing\" as an example of this behavior. You go to buy a given good, and find two choices-  one of which is slightly more expensive than the other, but promises that it was produced using \"Sustainable forestry\" or the like. \\n\\nNow, there are several problems with this. \\n\\nFirst of all, given that the \"Green\" option is more expensive at no actual added utility to the end-user, such consumerism is limited more to higher-income people who often buy not just for utility, but for cosmetic luxury and an appearance of being environmentally-friendly. In practice, this means that ethical consumerism is, at best, a mostly-irrelevant niche market, a lonely island in a sea of unethical behavior.\\n\\nSecondly, it puts the impetus on the consumer, not on the corporation to determine the responsible use of resources. A common argument used by libertarians is that issues like climate change and the globalized exploitation of sweatshop labor are self-limiting problems, as people will generally prefer the more humanitarian purchase. In practice, ethical consumerism is used as an excuse to abolish democratically-implemented regulations, leaving huge questions- the environment, workers rights, and the like to the will of a system that inherently values profit over superficial \"ethics\". \\n\\nWhether or not Florida is sunk by rising sea levels is not a triviality that should be left to making sure you buy the right soy sauce.

It\\'s all about the compatibility of the couples and their ability to raise children well. \\n\\nPersonal preface - I did not have a very happy childhood. I was raised by a single mother, and she, while caring, raised me very, very wrong, and I\\'ve come to realize that fact only relatively recently. I was a social shut-in, had a hard time making friends or even socializing with others throughout the high-school all thanks to bullying. That wouldn\\'t be so bad, if her \"advice\" didn\\'t \"destroy\" any development I had then as a person. Even now, I\\'m not OK, I\\'m not really fully sane at all. I\\'m a miserable being full of irrational hate towards quite a few things... Well, I won\\'t go on anymore. \\n\\nThere are many other children who have it even worse, even with both parents, because they are horrifyingly bad parents. They are brought into this world against their will by the dumb shits who should never ever have children. \\n\\nWhy continue this? It only causes misery for the children, trouble for the governments dealing with child abuse, etc. \\n\\nTogether with legal abortion, any illegal pregnancies should be aborted, and the parents fined/sentenced. And professional psychiatrists, government employed should evaluate couples if they are able to stay together and care for the child, and either give the permit, or not. \\n\\nThis system would not be without it\\'s flaws, because it would require a rather intrusive and annoying control, requiring you to show a child-bearing permit to police officers or anyone else enforcing said law. It would also do little against the poor, rural people who already breed like rabbits. But a few jail sentences and crippling fines would eventually curb it, as long as the foster care is strictly controlled by the government so that orphans have a good childhood.\\n\\nIt would get awkward with same-sex couples, but I\\'m sure the permit would allow them adoption instead. This would also really simplify adoption for them, hopefully.\\n\\nAnother hurdle is the evaluation experts themselves - it would require time for them to gain experience in order to evaluate couples well. It would most likely have to end - up as a very very well paid job, requiring the best of the best in human psychology. Which is not that bad of a way to attract people to that discipline.\\n\\nAlso the economic aspect - how to decide if a rather poor couple can have children? This ties in to my previous point - the evaluating professionals need to take everything in account, and predict possible outcomes - a very difficult, if at all possible task. But as long as the system makes sure that the neglected, abused and miserable children are nearly non-existent, it has done it\\'s job. As long as children grow up as more or less sane, healthy and functional human beings, the system has done it\\'s job, even if there are far less of them.\\n\\nTo clarify once again, I do not mean eugenics - aka gene based breeding. It\\'s all about only allowing the fit parents to have and raise children.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I believe that life is, in fact, an accident, and that our existence is coincidental. Being so I also don't believe in eternal truths, mainly in the notion that there is an inherent good that people should be trying to attain.\\n\\n If any purpose exists it is constructed within the person, for otherwise, why would people exist? It is not to serve nature, surely, for humans ultimately oppose nature, especially in modern society. In the case that there was a God, I suppose one could argue that we exists for the God's sake, but why? For entertainment? I am really not clear how purpose can be inherent and not constructed. \\n\\nThe same goes for the greater good. There does not seem to be a good that exists from with out the person or societies. If there were a greater\\xa0 objective good, why then, with the exception of murder and incest, are very few things seen as universally bad among all society's? And why are few things seen as universally good? For example, in America it is seen as wrong to arrange a marriage, especially among children under 18. But in many countries that is the standard. If a universal good exists, how come there is so much variance as to what is right and wrong?\\n\\nHowever, I believe this to be a good thing. As opposed to more traditional nihilism which equates meaningless to life being futile, I believe that the lack of a notion of a greater good or purpose, is a freeing thing. With no greater purpose or greater good, one can construct it for oneself. The most important thing becomes one's personal experience in the world, and maximizing that to its full potential. There is no worry of not meeting a cosmic standard; the standards are within yourself. And so, a person does not have to be limited from (most) any experience unless they so desire it.\\n\\nAs such, I would categorize myself as an ethical hedonist: without any inherent purpose, experience is the most important thing, and pleasurable experience being the greatest kind of experience, one should strive for that for themselves. However, because all people are on this journey, one person's search for pleasure cannot infringe on another. I fully believe if everyone felt this way, society would be more functional, as everyone would be operating on the basis of mutual respect. \\n\\n\\nSo Reddit, Change My View, about any and all of these things:\\n1. Life having a purpose\\n2. The existence of an inherent good\\n3. The absence of these being freeing\\n4.

A simplified version of this theory (because of the last item) is \"conservatives are motivated by disgust reactions\".\\n\\nMy point is, the problem is that Haidt\\'s methodology is flawed because he assumed the same things will effect a disgust reaction in liberals and conservatives. It is not true. His questions are too much conservative focused e.g. desecrating a flag. Liberals are simply disgusted by different things, for example desecreating knowledge: burning books or libraries.\\n\\nI think liberals feel more disgust over violence and blood for example. It is not simply a care/harm thing, I think perfectly voluntary violence like an MMA match with some blood will disgust liberals more than conservatives.\\n\\nSimilarly ask them about how they feel about shooting a dog who is in incurable pain and debilitating disability (and therefore it is a caring, not harmful act), liberals will feel more disgusted by it.\\n\\nSo if you balance your questions properly, you take into account different kinds of disgust, you don\\'t find liberals are less motivated by disgust than conservatives.\\n\\nSimilarly, it is not that liberals are less likely to respect authority, but more like they respect different authorities: the police less, and scientists more.\\n\\nIn loyalty Haidt focuses too much on loyalty to your nation or family and not your political movement or social class. \\n\\nMy view is that with properly balanced questionnaires that take into account that (US) liberals and conservatives are upset by different things, these differences would disappear. \\n\\nIn other words that it is mostly useless.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I\\'m saying that the waffles served at Waffle House don\\'t even qualify as waffles.\\n\\nLet\\'s relive my first Waffle House experience. I\\'ve recently moved to a college town, my team just won a football game, and I go to the local WH downtown, and I\\'m starving. I order two chocolate chip waffles. Imagine my surprise when I get two geometrically patterned pancakes with chocolate chips on top. I was outraged.\\n\\nNow you may be saying, hey, they\\'re still waffles, just not waffles to your liking. Let us look at the Merriam-Webster waffle definition.\\n\\n1waf·fle\\n\\\\ˈwä-fəl, ˈwȯ-\\\\\\nnoun\\n:a crisp cake of batter baked in a waffle iron\\n\\nWaffle House \"waffles\" fail to meet the crisp part of their definition. They are very thin, and only their checkered pattern distinguishes them from pancakes. Ladies and gentleman, a pattern of squares on baked batter does not a waffle make. True waffles are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and at least double the height of a pancake. \\n\\nEither Waffle House needs to change the name of the \"waffles\" they serve or change the recipe because innocent people are deceived daily by this social injustice. Also, I would like to eat at Waffle House, but I am only disappointed when I think about how my waffle craving will only be teased and never satisfied.

Women orgasm from stimulation of their clitoris. This pleasure will be called **orgasmic pleasure.**\\n\\nMen and women feel pleasure from other touching as well, like massages, kissing, oral sex, and anal sex (as a receiver), and this pleasure will be called **non-orgasmic pleasure** because it does not directly result in orgasm. \\n\\nThe typical idea of anal sex for a heterosexual couple is that the man penetrates the woman's anus with his penis. This gives the man orgasmic pleasure and *hopefully* gives the woman non-orgasmic pleasure.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nMy CMV is that is a man desires to penetrate his partner anally, knowing that she will not find orgasmic pleasure in it, he should be willing to be penetrated anally himself, also not finding orgasmic pleasure in it. Men's and women's anuses are not different; women are no more inherently prone to enjoy receiving anal sex than men are. \\n\\nNow, typically we do things that don't please us but that do please our partners because typically people take pleasure in pleasing their partners, so even if something doesn't initially please you, knowing that it pleases your partner causes you to take pleasure in it. For this reason, a woman may be more inclined to find being anally penetrated pleasurable (non-orgasmic) as she knows it will stimulate her male partner's penis for his orgasmic pleasure. If the roles were reversed within that same couple, and she was penetrating him anally, she'd have to be using a dildo, which does not give her orgasmic pleasure. For this reason, it is perfectly okay for a straight couple to only want to perform anal sex one way: the male penetrates the female. However, my CMV is only that the penetrating partner should be *willing* to be penetrated his/herself. If within his/her couple unit they two decide they don't want to do anal that way, then that's fine. But if he is going to ask to give it then he should be willing to receive it *if* that would bring his partner pleasure like it brings him.\\n\\nIf you want to penetrate your partner's anus you should be willing to have your anus penetrated too. If that never happens and your partner doesn't want to penetrate you, fine, but you should at least be willing and open to the idea if you want to do it to somebody else. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I just mean that I don't think that a business owes anything to the country it operates in if that service can be provided elsewhere at a lower cost. \\n\\nEdit 2: In regards to my original argument that I don't think there should be a stigma my view has changed in the following ways: \\n\\n1-companies have been known to fire employees in order to outsource their jobs. \\n\\n2-conditions of the outsourcing company can be very poor and unpredictable. \\n\\n3-outsourcing takes away many entry level jobs that would help an employee get their foot in the door. \\n\\n4-companies have been know to use unskilled workers to do skilled work in the name of saving money instead of actually talented skilled people. In other words, they're potentially slowing down technological advances so they can pay less for codes and systems that are bugged and written by people that don't know what they're doing and now they don't work properly. \\n\\nAgain it's not that I find these reasons necessarily wrong from a business standpoint. More from the perspective that I personally either find them shitty or distasteful therefore I can no longer say that I don't think there should be a stigma. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I am saying that the reason most professional athletes are professionals as opposed to amateurs is largely because they were genetically gifted. \\n\\n\\nSecond let me give a narrow definition of professional athlete to avoid the mental gymnastics I see on reddit: An athlete who plays in the generally accepted major league of their respective sport. Because I am American this generally means the NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, and by some measures the CFL which may or may not be considered minor league. I don't mind talking about other major leagues, but because I am American I probably will not know them.\\n\\nFinally, like all generalized statements it can not be said that *all* pros match what I said just that on average *most* do.\\n\\n\\nNow to the argument. I believe the reason most professional athletes are better than collegiate and minor league athletes is because of being genetically better suited to play a specific sport. Take for example that most NBA players are freakishly tall. No matter how dedicated a 5 foot tall man is the chances of him becoming a professional basketball player is next to none. In fact the shortest NBA athlete in history was 5 foot 3 inches so the chance that a 5 foot tall man can become a professional basketball player is statistically 0% if viewed as a percentage of 5 foot tall pros compared to the population. \\n\\n\\nNow look at 7 foot and taller aspiring basketball players, if you are 7 foot tall or taller the chance of becoming a basketball player, if you are American, in the NBA is 17%. 17% of of 7 foot and up people in the USA are basketball players. In my opinion this shows that genetics are what gives most aspiring athletes the needed push from being amateur to professional, the dedication is there but the genetics is what makes them great as opposed to good. This isn't just about how tall you are. It is the difference between a 100 millisecond reaction time opposed to a 90 millisecond reaction time. It is the difference between a 5.0 second 40 yd dash and a 4.7. For one particular skill the increase is minimal to moderate, but better genes help improve multiple skills resulting in a moderate to major difference compared to collegiate and minor league athletes.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Because most pro athletes share comparable dedication compared to amateur athletes in minor leagues, the main thing distinguishing the professionals from minor league athletes is better suited genetics.\"},\n {'title': 'CMV: Conservative is a word that has lost its political meaning in the united states and should no longer be used by anyone to describe political viewpoints.',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2mf5n3',\n  'selftext': \"Conservatives are not conserving any values, they are proponents of a new radical agenda.  \\n\\n-they advocate the right to own and possess technologically advanced, new types of weapons with power that would be considered super-powerful by anyone from historical past\\n-they advocate radical meddling in numerous foreign governments\\n-they advocate gerry mandering that in historical context is extreme\\n-they advocate no privacy rights and total police rights, which is historically extreme\\n-they advocate an ever growing military budget which is historically extreme\\n-they advocate high pressure fossil fuel mining which risks the entire potable water table of the united states which is historically extreme\\n-they advocate no actual conservation of resources, whether trees, water, metal, beauty\\n-they advocate imperialism which on any historical scale is extreme\\n-they advocate extreme centralized power\\ncmv\\n\\nedit: sorry I did not know about the 3 hour rule and it was saturday night, ill try to get to all these as soon as I can.  \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Obviously music enjoyment is not some scientific enterprise.  There is music that I don\\'t enjoy listening to, but understand how others could or see quality that I can appreciate.  Likewise, everyone has those guilty pleasure artists/songs where we know they\\'re bad, but love them anyway.  In either case, there is something *about* the music that we find good, whether an infectious melody or well-constructed lyrics or a wailing solo.\\n\\nWhich returns me to trap.  I find nothing about it aesthetically or musically appealing.  I can\\'t relegate it to \"I\\'m not into it, but can see why others do\" because I can\\'t see why others like it, which is why I turn to you, Reddit.  My objections are as follows:\\n\\n(1) Minimalism works against it.  Minimalism in music is not always bad.  I listen to other Electrohouse or DnB artists who use it to great effect.  It creates a great tension-and-release element to a song and when used well is orgasmic.  This tension is a staple in the Trap \"sound\", replacing the forceful Dubstep drop for a super low drone with a high minimalistic melody (generally speaking).  On an subjective level, this is musical blue balls, but I think I can make a case for this on a more objective level.  The reason the EDM staple of build-drop works is because of the tension-release cycle.  It\\'s like those amusement park rides that take you up 300 feet and then, well, drop you.  The exhilaration and force of the drop is sharpened by the slow buildup.  Trap, on the other hand, employs an almost identical build, and then the contrasted lack of sound at the drop serves as a different kind of experience.  Imagine if instead of dropping the full 300 feet, the ride drops you 50 feet.  You dont expect the stop and theres this juxtaposition of released tension and even more anticipation.  Trap as a genre embraces this latter example as its core, never rleasing the tension fully.  As a result, instead of effectively building a proper tension-release cycle, Trap leaves the listener unfulfilled.\\n\\nPossible rebuttal to (1): The amusement park model doesn\\'t work for Trap.  In that case, what is a better model with which to consider Trap?\\n\\n(2) Absence of complexity.  I\\'m not looking for Mozart the DJ.  Just something that gives the illusion of compositional knowhow.  1-3 note melodies are firstly boring and secondly a sign that the producer has no musical talent.  I would like skill in my music.  Trap as a genre feeds the instrumental-fetishist argument that electrobic music takes no skill because they don\\'t play a \"real instrument\".  EDM can do so much more, and I\\'ve heard it do so much more.  Just never in this genre.\\n\\nPossible rebuttal to (2): (a)You\\'re just being a snob and using it as an excuse for your subjective dislike.  Possibly, but I don\\'t think so.  Even if the bar were set really low (like One Direction low) maybe the best choruses of Trap (that are distinctly Trap, not simply elements of other EDM genres which automatically set the majority of trap above 1D) could surpass them in terms of quality.  Maybe. (b)Other genres have plenty of unremarkable musical complexity.  Agreed; however no genre (aside from Ambient Drone) makes melodic simplicity a defining feature of the genre itself.  (c) Simplicity is not always bad.  Agreed.  Some composers use simplicity very well and for a variety of aesthetic effects.  My argument is that Trap does not.\\n\\nIt\\'s likely that I won\\'t enjoy Trap music after this thread, but I do want to understand those that do like it, and if they like it, whether they actually think it constitutes quality music.  Thank you.\\n\\nEdit1: Formatting\\n\\nEdit2: This is not \"CMV: We can make objective judgments about aesthetic matters\".  My view includes as a presupposition that there is an objective (but limited) element to the appreciation of music.\\n\\nEdit3: I am referring to \"Second Wave\" characterized by heavy electronic music influences, rather than the original Trap which was a Hip-Hop offshoot.\\n\\nEdit4: Examples incoming\\n\\nExample 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZB_tXP84WU This is a fairly standard (in my mind) example of Trap elements.  808 steady drone with high-hats composing the background for a melody of, lets face it, one note with some ornaments.\\n\\nExample 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t_eU3tdy2g Remix also including elements mentioned above.  Better than most, but only just.\\n\\nExample 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL9OzPY4byQ Changing up the formula a little with this one.  The downtempo nature brings something different to the table, and its minimalism actually contributes to its overall feel.  Definitely not the norm, though.\\n\\nExample 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYBLylKa-vI  10 songs that could serve as an adequate standard for what I mean by \"Trap\".  Note that my argument is not that all sound the same, but that the similar features are the defining features of Trap, and that those features in themselves constitute poor music.'},\n {'title': \"CMV: If a woman had worn this shirt, nobody would've cared.\",\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2mczo6',\n  'selftext': \"[A link to the story, for those unaware](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-30055278).\\n\\nNow I want to preface this by saying two things: one, I identify as a feminist, as even a quick glance through my post history will attest; and two, I'm not necessarily saying I think the damn thing was a *good* idea, but I certainly don't think it was worth the to-do that's going on.\\n\\nFor those that don't wish to check out the link, one of the Rosetta scientists wore a shirt with some sexy, pseudo-pin-up style women on it.

I do consider NASCAR a physically demanding sport.

I do think it takes time to become a professional, and most people dont have the flexibility of life to simply drop everything and train to become a NASCAR driver.

Meanwhile there have been 364 brother pairs and close to 50 father/son pairs EVER in the NFL, and those numbers are before taking out groups like Archie, Peyton, and Eli or Howie, Chris, and Jake. This represents much less than 10% of the total NFL player base.

The view states that it is *good* that cultures abide by their idiosyncratic definition of the good.  Proponents of normative cultural relativism would also tend to hostility to those who would impose one set of cultural valuations on another culture.\\n\\nThis view is problematic for several reasons.  Firstly, it treats all change as being wrong, but then right as that change becomes established and institutionalised within a culture.\\n\\nTake for instance the position of women in society- for the longest time, women had no political representation and very little in the way of codified rights.  What would a relativist have to say about such a state of affairs?  Nothing, of course, except to convey a blithe sense of pluralistic approval.   However, English moral philosophers (particularly of utilitarian bent) like Bentham and Mill argued from their principles that women deserve political representation and rights **a hundred years in anticipation of feminism**.  The relativist is bound to decrying this moral foresight as lunacy on part of those that first conceived of it, or as a wicked sort of moral perversion.  If the culture is always right, morality is mob rule.\\n\\nFurther, the intuition that we should live and let live, abstaining from enforcing our beliefs and will on other cultures is self-defeating within the context of cultural relativism.  What if my culture approves of violent and exploitative colonialism?  It does not follow from the view that all culture\\'s ethical beliefs are \"right for them\" that the violent imposition of my own cultural values is wrong.  Further, it would seem to state that my culture (or at least its attitude to colonialism) actually is wrong in some objective sense.  This is a completely arbitrary specification.\\n\\nWe can be moral realists whilst taking into account cultural differences.  If in culture A, dying one\\'s hair purple is grievously hurtful to a lot of people but in culture B it is not, then that behaviour assumes a different moral importance relative to culture.  But this leaves room for moral realism and ethical systems like consequentialism without arbitrarily asserting the ethical supremacy of culture.

The reason autism rates are rising is that we live in an [increasingly narcissistic society](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;ei=-yRmVOiiB4LLsAT0iICYBg&amp;url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201401/why-is-narcissism-increasing-among-young-americans&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXvWd5iV-TbI2Tv_gl5JQfRlNv8Q) and a narcissistic mother is often just too self-absorbed to care much about anyone else, including her children - read some /r/raisedbynarcissists for mindblowing stories about this.  There may also be resentment toward the child for the body changes associated with pregnancy and childbirth for a narcissistic woman who places high emphasis on her body, which may help explain why rates of autism are higher for firstborn children.\\n\\nWe learn at a phenomenal rate as infants, so much and so fast that if we miss the window of opportunity to learn certain things we never get another chance.  I remember reading somewhere that if an infant were blindfolded for the first three months of life and then had the blindfold removed, it would be blind for the rest of its life.\\n\\nThink of an infant getting adequate maternal attention: mom\\'s friendly face invites interaction, they babble back and forth at one another, there\\'s plenty of eye contact - all things autists struggle with.  Now imagine an infant without these things...  it will take note of \"things\" in the absence of people, eg. that it has 6 stuffed animals, or that there are 28 books on the bookshelf - stuff autists tend to notice.  We have strong evidence that nurture (rather, lack thereof) is at least a factor from the Romanian orphans referenced in the Time link below.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t evolve with easy distractions such as TV, shopping malls, iPhones, etc. and so we didn\\'t evolve countermeasures to being extremely neglected during the crucial first few months / years of life.  Even in the case of maternal death the tribe would look after an infant.  It\\'s only now in the modern, western, suburban world that a woman can put an infant in a crib and ignore it as she focuses on herself.\\n\\nThe \"refrigerator mother\" hypothesis which gained popularity in the 1940s only fell out of vogue in the 60s-70s due to pressure from feminism and its assertion that women are perfect and may never be criticized.  The actual evidence against it, as well as evidence for a genetic cause of autism, is scarce.  Science has been shamed into losing its objectivity here, as is so often the case.  For example cannabis is only now escaping stigma and prohibition based on a few flawed studies, and the studies which have recently shed light on the substance were restricted for decades, if allowed at all.\\n\\nAt almost 40 years old I\\'m too ancient to have ridden the aspergers diagnosis wave, but I\\'m positive I would have been diagnosed if I were 10-15 years younger.

I think college is a useful resource for many people who want to go into specialized occupations-- for instance, law, psychology, medicine, anthropology, teaching, etc.  There are specialized fields in which the only place with the resources to teach them is a university.  I also think that liberal arts education is a good program for these sorts of students, because it exposes them to knowledge outside of the academic tedium to which they will likely be bound to in their career--teaches people who are very interested in one subject to poke their heads up every once in a while.\\n\\nBUT, college is becoming \"second high school.\"  Anyone who is smart is supposed to go to college, or else they\\'re considered subpar citizens of some sort.  There\\'s a major for everything now--even though many subjects are not well suited to academia.  \\n\\nFor instance, the best way to become a musician is to find a teacher [AKA better musician,] practice and work enough to eat and pay said teacher, and then practice until you can convince a better teacher to let you pay them to teach you, and then repeat until you\\'re good enough that somebody will pay you to do music.

She is my best friend as well as my lover, and we do almost everything together. I don\\'t want to marry her because I don\\'t like the marriage and divorce laws regarding assets and debts. I see minimal benefit to a legal marriage, but a big risk if we don\\'t work out as life partners. She is happy with how things are, but I think she would like it a bit if we were \"official\".\\n\\nI\\'m a little older than her, I have a good paying professional job, own the house we live in, and have some money invested in stocks. I invest a large chunk of my pay. I know what is mine before marriage would stay mine, but I am planning to continue to pay off my mortgage and invest a lot of my income. She is still in school, working on becoming a high-paid professional too. She will likely take out more student loans in the years to come. I am pretty certain she will continue to spend a lot more money than me on things like lattes and clothes. I am totally fine with this, but if we shared finances I would feel like she was buying stuff I don\\'t care about with \"our\" money, and the money I was saving would also become \"ours\". I don\\'t want to get married and pretend our finances are separate, knowing that if we get divorced the courts will split everything 50/50 (I live in a community property state, meaning assets and debts acquired during marriage are joint). I also don\\'t want to do a pre-nup. To make it legit, both of us would need attorneys during the process, which is expensive. We already live like we are married, it seems silly to get the marriage certificate, and do more paper work to undo a big chunk of what the marriage certificate does. I\\'m also concerned that she would not like the pre-nup process, and it might make getting married not as fun.\\n\\nI am pretty certain I will accumulate wealth much faster than she. I want to share this wealth with her while we are together, but if for some reason we don\\'t work out I want to keep what I have worked hard to earn, and not be responsible for any debts she may still have. Many times the lower earning person helps the higher earner to make more money. This is not the case with us, we split all the housework and stuff evenly. I\\'d be wealthier if I were single (mainly because I\\'d get roommates and charge them rent), but I have no complaints because I love living with my girl and spending some money so we can have a blast. On the flip side, I am pretty sure she will be wealthier with me than if single or with someone else. I know a lot about personal finance, I give her as much advice as she will tolerate (haha), and will encourage her to practice good financial habits and establish financial security of her own.\\n\\nWe don\\'t have kids, but if we do we will figure out a fair way to divide labor, because we are both intelligent and can work out a good deal for both of us. If we think it is best for her to take some time off to be a SAHM, I am confident we will figure out a fair deal, including some compensation for missed career building. Or, maybe she\\'ll SAH the first few years, and I\\'ll SAH the next few years.\\n\\nI think the reason we have these divorce laws is because most people don\\'t plan ahead for things. Divorce law is a crappy one-size-fits-all way to handle the problem, better than nothing but it still sucks. I have no problem publicly committing my love to the woman I want to spend my life with, but will not go along with the government dictating how we handle our finances. I don\\'t want to get married, ever.\\n\\n*Edit: I have talked to her about all this. I also want to hear other opinions. Thanks!*\\n\\n*Edit 2: Her view on marriage changes a lot. Sometimes she thinks the whole thing is stupid and we should never get married, but sometimes she\\'ll ask me if I want to. I think the rational side of her thinks it\\'s dumb, but the emotional side of her feels kinda left out by not being married.*\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, I do have a problem with the idea of \\'rape culture\\', despite its widespread acceptance within the movement. I think that many of its assertions, especially to do with the root causes of behaviour, are based on extremely shaky evidence. I do not think that social attitudes to rape are substantially different from attitudes to other crimes, and I think that proponents of the \\'rape culture\\' idea take an almost entirely one-sided view of social attitudes, and ignore the evidence that rape is, in fact, socially unacceptable to the vast majority of people. I know that this view puts me at odds with a lot of people who I otherwise agree with, so I\\'ll briefly explain the aspects of the \\'rape culture\\' idea that I find problematic and hopefully somebody will be able to change my view.\\n\\nThe media/pornography\\n\\nMany proponents of \\'rape culture\\' see the portrayal of rape and sexual violence in the mainstream media or in pornography as dangerous. They argue that viewing these images may make people more likely to rape, or at least make people think that it is more acceptable. But people are perfectly capable of distinguishing fantasy or fiction from reality, and, as far as I am aware, there is little quantitative evidence to back up these claims. Nobody would suggest that \\'Oceans 11\\' normalises theft or makes people more likely to rob casinos. The release of GTA, despite its huge popularity, has not been accompanied by a rise in muggings, theft, murders or high-speed car chases. \\n\\nVictim blaming\\n\\nAny suggestion that women can take steps to protect themselves from rape, or can put themselves in dangerous situations, is met by accusations of \\'victim blaming\\' and the tacit accusation that those making the suggestion think rape is excusable. Of course there are some cases in which this is justified, and I have no wish to defend those who think women who are raped must have been \\'asking for it\\'. The basic principle that people have some responsibility to avoid becoming the victims of crime in general is, however, widespread and not limited to rape. Home insurers will not pay out to claimants who leave their doors open. Walking through a rough area of town bedecked with expensive jewellery is seen as a sure-fire way to get mugged, and if you leave your phone in a bar, you bear some responsibility for it having been stolen. It may well be that assigning blame and responsibility to the victims of crime in general is wrong and that attitudes need to change, but this is a general issue pertaining to our perception of crime and not a specific facet of a \\'rape culture\\'.\\n\\nDegrees of rape/grey areas\\n\\nMany people dislike the idea of degrees of rape, insisting instead that \\'rape is rape\\'. We are, however, prepared to accept degrees of murder and manslaughter. As a society we punish armed robbery more severely than petty theft. There are also grey areas which sometimes make it difficult to say exactly whether a crime has been committed, for example assisted suicide. Most people would agree that buying a girl a drink to make her like you more is fairly normal, and that getting her so drunk that she doesn\\'t know what she is doing is illegal, but there are about 15 shots of tequila in between the two. In some cases, the differences between suggestion, persuasion, coercion and outright compulsion are difficult to pin down exactly and depend on the intentions and feelings of the individuals involved.\\n \\nSympathy for perpetrators\\n\\nThere have been some cases, notably Steubenville in the US, where sympathy for rapists has been denounced. It has been suggested that this unfairly neglects the victims, and even in some quarters that it amounts to denial or tacit approval of the crime. Sympathy for criminals is, however, not limited to rape cases. People feel sorry for thieves, drug dealers or even murderers whose background includes poverty, violence, abuse, poor access to education and lack of legitimate opportunity. Expressing sympathy for such people does not amount to approving of their crimes or thinking that they do not need to be punished. Again, the extent to which we feel sympathy for criminals is a general social issue to be discussed, not evidence that we live in a \\'rape culture\\'.\\n\\nRape jokes\\n\\nPeople make jokes about all kinds of things, and yet rape jokes are seen by many as fostering and promoting \\'rape culture\\'. However, nobody would suggest that,\"that\\'s a nice car - shame they didn\\'t leave the keys in it\" fosters a culture of theft, or that jokes about murdering your mother in law normalise and desensitize people to murder. \\n\\nI would never disagree with the sentiment that rape should be taken seriously and prosecuted where possible, or that measures should be put in place to reduce its impact in society. In fact, it is such a serious problem that I think we need to tackle it not through misleading terminology and concepts based on questionable assumptions, nor by dogmatic adherence to ideologically-driven statements, but through a sensible and evidence-based discussion.  \\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There were some standard arguments against this, like how it was inhumane to pay someone so little and make them work so many hours. There were also some standard arguments in favor of this saying that the standard of living was lower in other countries and that they were actually getting paid more than anything else they could be doing. \\n\\nAnyway, fast forward 20 years. We don't really have the same kind of controversy about sweatshops in China. In fact, I feel that the amount of money that we have sent over there has given them the ability to industrialize. They have enough money that they are able to refuse to perform sweatshop work. Their standards of living are high enough where it no longer makes sense to take a sweatshop job. AKA they are able to make more money doing something else. It is no longer makes economical sense to put factories in China. Instead, I find that more clothes are coming from places like the Philippines, and Bangladesh, where I suspect people are willing to work for less money. I expect that around 20 years from now, the Philippines and Bangladesh will be rich enough where they will turn down sweatshop jobs too.\\n\\nThe sweatshop work in China seems to have been replaced by technology shops, like producing Iphones. This is quite a nice upgrade compared to a sweatshop job, and would not be possible without first industrializing the country. The new controversy nowadays seem to be about people being underpaid and overworked in iphone factories. The characters are different, but the story sounds the same. Same arguments about inhumane treatment, same arguments about how this is in fact good for them.\\n\\nI feel this type of bad press is detrimental to the development of a land. I believe Philippines / Bangladesh will soon get their turn to say no to sweatshop jobs and follow China's path in upgrading to nicer technology jobs. To stop these factories will simply deny them of the resources they need to raise their standard of living.\\n\\nCMV!!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Sure, it\\'s impossible to disprove the existence of God-like entities - concepts that share interesting features of God but are in no way, shape, or form any way related to the personal Gods (such as Allah or Yahweh) as believed by human society. Outside of philosophy, I don\\'t see why anybody would be particularly interested in this form of God that has absolutely no practical consequence on humanity. What I\\'m interested in is the Gods that people actually believe in - the personal God that affects your daily life, that personally intervenes in your life to make it better, the one that\\'s here to save your soul. \\n\\n\\nI spent a good chunk of my life trying to find Yahweh or any other God. I couldn\\'t find any sign of him whatsoever in this universe that we inhabit. And not only me, no scientist has found much of a trace of Him. Most Churches can\\'t even find him either - instead, they must rely on Faith that He is there.\\n\\nIs it possible that \"personal Gods\" exist? Maybe. But as the search for that personal God continues, the probability that He exists diminishes to zero. How many times must I re-scan that dark room of Alex and Bob to ensure that the 3rd man does not exist? Every single lack of observation reaffirms the positive belief that \"No, the third man does not exist\", just like \"The Personal God does not exist\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith new and updated observations of reality that continue to yield absolutely no evidence of God, the probability of the existence of God continues to diminish to zero. The discovery of classical mechanics proved that God wasn\\'t needed to *actively* move heaven and Earth. The discovery of Evolution proved that God was not needed to actively create Life. Each new discovery reaffirms the fact that God does not intervene in the natural world using \"unnatural\" means. Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"mechanism that which drives the laws of nature\". Sure, you can go ahead and redefine God to be the \"Universe\". But that sure is hell far, far away from the God of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Mormons, and everyone else that believe in Gods. \\n\\nAtheism permits the possible existence of super-powerful, God-like creatures that may share many or even all of the features that are attributed to God. It\\'s not unimaginable that an alien race has achieved such incredible powers to be even more powerful than the God as described in the Old Testament. These \"Gods\" may be so incredibly intelligent or powerful that they are unimaginable by human intelligence. But they\\'re not supernatural. They\\'re not the personal God believed by humanity that reincarnates you or whisks you off to heaven. I\\'m also sure you\\'ve heard of the simulation argument, that there is a \"super-universe\" on top of ours that controls us, much like how we play videogames that create \"sub-universes\" that we have near total control over. However, this version of God is in great contrast to the God imagined by most people. Most people don\\'t believe that God is a supernatural Nerd playing his world\\'s version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. This conception of God at least takes care of the problem of \"Evil\" quite easily - but no human would call the supernatural Nerd a \"God\". I\\'m pretty sure that the vast majority of gnostic atheists all can permit these kind of \"nearly supernatural\" beings to exist. Hell, why not describe Jesus Christ as a space alien that decided to land on Earth to fuck with the natives? But even if Alien Jesus shares all the same attributes as the actual Jesus, for some reason, it\\'s different. Alien Jesus loses that sort of \"supernatural mystery\" that is the crux of atheist antipathy towards religion. \\n\\n\\n\\nGnostic atheism is defensible. We know that particular Gods as believed by the vast majority of humanity can not be found and can only be believed through a mechanism called \"Faith\". We\\'ve tried as best as we can to find these personal Gods, just like Alex tried to find the 3rd man, but all evidence suggests that the 3rd man simply does not exist. Alex is not agnostic about the 3rd man. Alex is fucking sure the 3rd man simply is not there! \\n\\n\\nHumanity always strives to learn more and more about the world they live in and the universe in general. Agnostics throw their hands in the air and say, \"We don\\'t know!\" Gnostic atheists continue the search for God - and when each search yields no results, their belief is reaffirmed that God does not exist. You don\\'t have to believe in God to look for Him. But when both atheists and theists attempt to search for God and yield no results, it\\'s utterly insane IMO to declare yourself to be \"agnostic\". The bipartisan search party found nothing again. What\\'s there to be unsure about?? (Ironically, if anything, it\\'s the atheists that search for God in far more vigor than most theists ever would. Theists believe through faith. Atheists try to find God but can never see Him). \\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m only arguing about semantics here. But I\\'m tired of reading what I believe is bullshit, \"Atheism is the *lack* of belief\". Come on. The vast majority of atheists actively believe that personal Gods such as Allah do not exist. Some people have a weird fetish of trying to redefine atheism from the traditional sense of the word, to the confusion of everyone else. \\n\\nMany Agnostics and Theists gave up on the search for God. They just decided either to believe or not to care. But IMO, any person that actively searches for God\\'s existence will eventually become an atheist, because every time he looks, nothing is found. \\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I've seen instances recently of children in middle school learning simple integer division and multiplication.  When I consult my peers, future teachers, about this, they defend the system claiming that the teachers must teach to the test.  I find this unacceptable for several reasons, but most of those are unrelated.\\n\\nChildren have an outstanding capacity for learning when faced with the proper motivation, any argument that a child simply cannot handle more difficult content is insulting.  This assumption that children don't hold the ability to learn at a higher rate often results in a failure to reach the fullest potential.  In addition to this failure on the education system's part, it instills a sense of complacency within children that they should never be challenged to learn something.  This becomes very clear as I watch courses become diluted and spread out over longer periods of time.\\n\\nSo what stands to be gained from increasing the rigor and difficulty of a child's education?  First let's analyze the benefits as a society.  After completion of a more rigorous curriculum, a student will have progressed much further in every math and science course.  In addition to this knowledge that is otherwise not learned, the student has a much more firm understanding of writing and reading comprehension, although the benefits for English and History are much more limited than in the applied sciences.  Let's choose an arbitrary number of years that the student was able to progress in addition to a standard curriculum, although any increase in progress will yield great results.  Just two additional years of applied math or science classes that can be taken as a result of a more difficult curriculum can prepare a student for a large number of college programs in those respective fields as well as any number of related fields.  Practically speaking, it prepares students for the applied sciences.  In the case that the student wants to pursue education in this field, they will have an easier time, and possibly save money.  Furthermore, the world will *always* need more bodies in the applied sciences.  \\n\\nJust look around, in the U.S. some of the most popular undergraduate majors are business, psychology, and communications.  In many instances, and no disrespect to those who study in those fields, students perceive the previously listed to be easier than other choices.  I've had conversations with people who chose to study each of those because they sounded fun or easy.

Kentucky\\'s coach, John Calipari, thinks his team would get \"buried\" by NBA teams and I completely agree with him.\\n\\nTake for instance, the 2012 Kentucky team that won the NCAA championship that season and was historically elite, breaking the Division 1 record for most wins in a season and featured 4 first round picks in the following NBA draft. Three of those players, Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and Marquis Teague, were the consensus no. 1 overall player, small forward, and point guard respectively for their high school recruiting class. Of course, Davis is quickly becoming an NBA superstar, but in his rookie season in the NBA while he was quite good for a rookie, he was only overall a slightly above average player, averaging 13.5 PPG, 8.2 RPG, 1 APG, and 1.8 BPG. Teague, Kidd-Gilchrist, and the fourth Wildcat picked in the first round Terrence Jones, preformed considerably worse in their rookie season, particularly Jones who spent most of the season in the D-league, and Kidd-Gilchrist, who suffered from an incredibly broken shooting form.\\n\\nSo, bearing in mind the best player from one of the best college squads of all time was only slightly above average the following year in the NBA, along with the fact that NBA players as a whole are simply bigger, stronger, faster, and smarter than college players, not even the 2012 Wildcats could keep up with a historically bad team like this years/last years Philadelphia 76ers, or the 2011-2012 Charlotte Bobcats, now the Hornets.

Try as I might, I just can\\'t see how at least the first part of the statement could be false. I present this in the true spirit of CMV, I feel like I might be missing something.\\n\\nMy particular view is that in a number of Disney movies, the heroes skins are Caucasian and the villains skins are shades of dark (brown, purple, grey), and that this creates an association between evil and dark skin that children pick up very easily. There are plenty of Disney movies where this is not the case, but there are enough that it is an issue: Aladdin, Lion King, Little Mermaid, Mulan, Hercules (probably more).\\n\\nBeyond this obvservation, there are a variety of arguments that many Disney movies are racist:\\n\\n* [An article](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/06/repressed-brits-evil-mexicans-arab-villains-hollywood-animated-movies-stereotypes) from the Guardian detailing the history, mainly from a stereotype + voice actor\\'s race angle.\\n\\n* [A listicle](http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/most-racist-moments-disney-movies-cartoons/) with plenty of video links, some back to the 20s &amp; 30s. Is there anyone that will argue that even these are not harmfully racist? And if they are harmfully racist, at which point did the racism disappear or become benign?\\n\\n* [Diversity in Disney Films](http://www.amazon.com/Diversity-Disney-Films-Ethnicity-Disability/dp/0786446013/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415665430&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=disney+race) - a collection of Essays.\\n\\n* [Several more books](http://www.amazon.com/Diversity-Disney-Films-Ethnicity-Disability/dp/0786446013/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415665430&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=disney+race) on Amazon.\\n\\nSo, where are the well reasoned arguments that these depictions are not racist? I think there is some fundamental disagreement between my friend and I on the way meaning is created and, thus, how media works. For her, the \"darkness\" evoking evil stops there, it is only incidental that skin is being used as the pallet. (She goes on to joke about blue people being offended by Genie, etc...) \\n\\nFurther, she believes that the model is just too simple. That the mechanisms of racism are much more complicated than this belief allows and that it is this kind of thinking that leads to rampant Political Correctness. This is possibly why I am most interested in this argument. I find many arguments that lead to rampant PC to be compelling, but I certainly detest the world in which we are all policing each other for racial, feminist, etc.. correctness.\\n\\nFor me, it naturally follows that if these characters are teaching negative stereotypes about race, then they are harmful to children as they learn about the world. If you agree that the movies are racist, but that they don\\'t have that big of an impact on children, I\\'d be interested in those arguments as well.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'m much more interested in scholarly or at least well-studied arguments than how you personally \"feel\" about the subject without deep consideration.

I believe it was on of the biggest shocks to my personal views on the world. All my life I suffered from lack of sexual/social success, I wasn't confident, I didn't know how to deal with people around me and I basically reverted to being a nice guy, which is something people &amp; pop-culture advocates through advice, movies, selective presentation by the media and so forth. \\n\\nWhen I was introduced to the PUA community 2 years ago, and eventually TRP a few months ago, it was the first time in my life I was given helpful advice on how to become someone who can actually make it in today's society in terms of being social/sexual. Those communities taught me about confidence, staying true to myselfself, embracing my sexuality and most of all become the best version of myself and aim for the stars, in a way that is actually applicable to the real world, and not in the form of some cliched advice that people oblivious to those concepts could possibly grasp and implement.\\n\\nI do agree with a lot of statements regarding TRP making generalizations about women, to a point of de-humanizing them. But on the other hand, there is no other community that gives you genuine advice on how to become that successful person you always wanted to be and reach your goals in life, and I sincerely believe that someone who will ignore the MRA-oriented side of TRP and focus on the advice they give on self-improvement (as proven mostly true by people's 'Field Reports'), will prosper beyond his imagination and there's no competition in that field. The world is a harsh place full of mostly ego-centric people that will not reach out for people with that kind of weaknesses, and one must seek it out in places like TRP to have a chance of actually bettering theirselves.\\n\\nThe reason I believe that is by looking at facts :\\n\\nBefore being exposed to the PUA community and TRP : I had no courage to even talk to a girl I had interest in, was socially awkward and was made fun of most of my teenage years. This applies to a lot of men my age who you could see for a fact that didn't even know how to deal with those kind of issues and suddenly it's like they swallowed a magic pill.\\n\\nAfter : Learned to take the initiative and lead the interaction (as directly suggested by those communities), take responsibility for sexual escalation (which doing only half-assed while not being experienced always turned girls off), and finally lost my virginity. Also, I am generally much more confident, got rid of most of my depressive nature and people actually like to be around me way more than before. \\n\\nChange my view.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n\"},\n {'title': \"CMV: I believe if an underage person lies about their age to have sex with somebody, that person shouldn't be guilty of statutory rape.\",\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2lwloy',\n  'selftext': 'If you are at a club (especially one that is supposed to check IDs to make sure everybody is of age) and you take home a girl there that tells you they are 18, you should be able to legally have sex with them as long as you genuinely believe they are of age.  \\n\\nFrom my understanding, as the law stands, someone can even show you a fake ID to prove their age and you are still at fault for having relations with a minor.\\n\\nHow can somebody reasonable be at fault for a crime that they not only have no knowledge of committing, but actively try to avoid committing?  To me that makes about as much sense as being charged with shoplifting because a cashier forgot to scan an item.  \\n\\nI expect many people might try to argue \"oh, well people will just claim they didn\\'t know the age to get away with sleeping with somebody who is underage\", however I believe that it is much better to err on the side of not punishing an innocent person here and destroying their lives, rather than attempting to punish an adult for something that was done consensually.  Also, it should be pretty easy to tell in most cases whether the accused actually knew the person was underage or not.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I understand that they are a metric for accessing our understanding of a topic, and that they are used to see if we know enough to move along in our education, and even to try to incentivise us to actually put in effort and pay attention, but I don\\'t think they really do anything but add undo stress and frustration which detracts from potential learning. I\\'m should clarify, I love to learn and I constantly hunt for video tutorials and web series about science and computers and mathematics because it is interesting to learn, but I hate \\'education\\' as the formal system used to try and teach us. \\n\\nHere\\'s the trouble I have with grades such as homework and to an extent tests: \\n\\n* They add stress on students to get things right the first time rather than encouraging them to learn from their mistakes and grow. With homework, there isn\\'t really that chance. Because it\\'s a grade, it\\'s an assessment. It\\'s asking *\"did you understand what we did in class and can you get this correct\"* rather than asking *\"what didn\\'t you understand and where can we grow\"*. \\n* They pull students down, and for a lot of students who want to get into colleges and get scholarships, the thought of a bad grade on homework which should be helping us learn is just stress that we might fail and be punished for life because of it. \\n* A lot of subjects simply don\\'t make sense with multi-choice exams and tests. Classes like English and History often ask \"what is the best answer\" which doesn\\'t prove if people had the knowledge and intellect to reason, only that they can think like the exam writer. I much prefer short answer.\\n* Maths and Science answers can often be ruined by a single step in an equation, so should be graded on the work not the final answer.\\n* They suck the passion out of students, which is the opposite of what you want from someone you\\'re trying to teach.

I don\\'t think any people are different because of their appearance, nationality, or religion. I *do* however believe that like people stick together even in multicultural countries like the U.S. and our cultural differences are still there.\\n\\nI don\\'t think that European people hold a lot of power in the world while third world countries exist because we oppressed or exploited them. I think it\\'s pretty evident that Greco-Roman ideas helped jumpstart our civilization. While some people like to argue that \"throughout history whites oppress other races, from the beginning of time\" thats really not true. White people were pretty much at the same place as everybody else until Rome. Pretty much everywhere that the Romans conquered was inhabited by white people. It was Greco-Roman ideas that surfaced after the fall of the Roman empire that gave us things like empiricism and rationalism, as you all know. \\n\\nWhite people started to become really \"oppresivish\" during the colonial era, which a lot of people also like to talk about. Well during this time, thanks to navigation, European powers started exploring and their influence began to stretch across the ocean. Trade became more global and not limited to neighbors. Enlightenment thinkers started thinking about shit like the nature of government and the economy. The latter was really important because Mercantilism was pretty much the school of thought that ruled the era. Because of mercantilism, colonies were good, and they traded with their colonies for raw goods that nobody else could have. Both sides were benefitting from this trade, mind you, even Africa was making money. So with all this thinking about politics, the stage became much more global, and the Europeans knew how to play it thanks to all these new ideas from the Enlightenment era. When people talk about how \"white people start all these horrible wars and blah blah blah blah\", what they\\'re talking about wars that are much larger scale than the ones fought by third world countries like the world wars or the seven years war. The reason why these wars happen on such a huge scale is because Europeans are much more involved in global politics because of the enlightenment era. \\n\\nThird world countries exist today because they really don\\'t want change socially and let go of old cultural traditions. For instance, in the Middle East they\\'re still fighting age old wars over religion and cultural differences, and in Africa the people can\\'t establish a stable governments because the people don\\'t want to die and the people leading the civil wars are only interested in their own benefit. Some places that were just as exploited as the Middle East/Africa or arguably even more so are hugely powerful today. Despite the fact that the Brits basically turned their country into a massive drug den, China is a massive economic and military power. Japan was also \"exploited\" by Europe, but they also came out a massive military power that competed in the second world war. Its because they went out and modernized the shit out of themselves with some proper leadership.\\n\\nI think that today, the racial disparity in the United States and elsewhere can be blamed more on our cultures than our skin color. There are a lot of rich white people. But there are also a lot of rich indian and asian immigrants as well. Indian and asian americans make ~$26,000 and ~$12,000 dollars more, respectively, on average than \"whites\". Then, African Americans make $20,000 less on average than whites, and hispanics make ~$10,000 less. The argument is supposed to be that immigrants are put down and the evil white capitalists exploit the minorities for money.\\n\\nThink about this for a second. Asians come from a culture where hard work and honor is highly valued. Indians come from a culture where doing your best in society is extremely important. Europeans, more specifically white americans in this case, come from a culture where it is well known that hard work and initiative is required to make it in the world. Black people and hispanics don\\'t have that as a part of their culture. African americans are staying in the ghetto not because they don\\'t have opportunities, but because African American culture encourages crime rather than legitimate lifestyles. Black people grow up in the hood, see all the cool gangbangers selling drugs, and hearing rappers talk about money and chains. They wanna cut school, go sling dope and kill people. If they just did well in school they could easily break the chain of poverty in their family. If their parents were telling them from the time that they are born that they need to work hard to make it and if they don\\'t that they will be a disgrace, I bet there would be many more successful blacks.\\n\\nAnyway, this post got a little long, so I\\'ll just say:\\n\\nTL;DR: White people experienced enlightenment. Because enlightenment, we play the world stage. Minorities are poor because their culture makes it so.

She has been fighting for a few years now, and has had some brutal knockouts.  UFC commentator Joe Rogan has come under fire from news outlets for voicing a similar opinion to the one expressed in this post.\\n\\nShe was born as Boyd Burton, a man, and served in the military in her early twenties as a male, before working as a trucker to pay for her gender reassignment.  After her operation, she has started fighting professionally over the last couple of years.  She has stated that she picked up MMA in her gym in her late twenties, and now she is brutalizing the women of the UFC.  \\n\\nI want to be clear in that I whole-heatedly support her right to live her life in any style she sees fit as long as she's not hurting anyone.  However, despite removing her penis and testicles, receiving breast implants, and undergoing hormone treatments, I am of the opinion that she still has a male frame and should not be allowed to compete with female fighters professionally.\\n\\nThere is a reason we segregate the sexes in professional sports, especially MMA.  Men and women simply compete on a different level.  I'm not saying that there are not women who are talented, disciplined, and gifted athletes, as there are a myriad of examples of badass women in professional sports.  But, in the case of MMA, the male frame can simply hit harder and exert more strength.  This gives fighters like Fallon Fox a distinct and unfair (dangerous, even) advantage over fighters born with a female frame.\\n\\nI will respect Fallon Fox and other transgender persons as much as I would any other person, I will refer to her as a female, I have no problem with any sexual partners she decides to take.  But in this case and others like it, transgender fighters are not only fighting from an unfair advantage, but pose a substantial danger to natural born women fighting in the UFC.  Not only that, but it trivializes the lifetime of work that every other fighter has put forth to fight at a professional level.  The fact that Fallon Fox started fighting in her late twenties and is now beating down women who have dedicated their entire lives to the sport is ridiculous.\\n\\nSo Reddit, do you agree?  Should Fallon Fox be considered a legitimate female fighter?  Are her victories hollow?  Let me know what you think!

I am also an avid Notre Dame fan, and Seahawks fan. \\n\\nI believe people watch sports for three reasons. \\n\\nFirst, they want to watch the best play at their peak. They want to see talent manifest itself. They want to see spectacular feats of strength, speed, intelligence, and dexterity. They want to see what humans are capable of when pushed to the limit. \\n\\nSecond, they want a connection with the human behind the athlete. For example, if I really wanted to, I could probably go to Denver and try to meet Payton Manning somewhere. Yeah it would be creepy, but I know he is a real person living somewhere, with a family, and a mortgage, just like me. I can go up to him and ask him how his kids are, what\\'s the best place to get a steak, and so on. \\n\\nThird, they want something to root for. They want to feel invested in something bigger than themselves. They want to feel like they won the game, even though it was their team that won. \\n\\nLeague of Legends I believe is doing a mediocre job at the second area, and a pretty good job at the third. Games like smash do a great job at the first, but ignore the other two areas. \\n\\nUnless you play the game, there is little reason why anyone else would watch, especially if you take out everything it means to be a fan. \\n\\nFor example, I am a fan of Jason Zimmerman. I enjoy watching him play. He is unstoppable when he is on top of his game. His ability to think and adapt as well as his deep understanding of the game mechanics makes him a very enjoyable player for me to watch. But he also has his flaws.

That is seen across cultures and even across species. Simply put, men want sex more than women, they just do. Sure 14 or 15 year old boys may not have the mental and/or emotional capability to fully consent to sex, but pretending that boys at that age don't want sex is completely disingenuous -- and so is pretending that girls by and large are as driven by sexual motives as boys.

Being fewer people may decrease the overall BNP, but I\\'d say the average person would have a higher purchase power and simple jobs would pay more money because it wouldn\\'t be any competition for \"low-paying\" jobs like today. It\\'s true that political and economical system greatly affects this as well, but it\\'s not the only explanation. Take China today, it\\'s a capitalistic economy in 2014, and the competition is extremely high for all kinds of jobs hence why salaries are pressed down, especially for entry level positions. Now, take Denmark or Sweden, countries with a low population. They have until recently (because of extreme mass immigration) had good wages for low skilled jobs and plenty of openings. For example, a fresh high school graduate can get a 60,000 dollar/year work in the mines, and more with over time. Because the demand is very big but there are not so many people to press down wages, even if it\\'s unskilled work that anyone can do. The same job in China barely pays subsistence level.\\n\\nAnother positive thing with keeping the population low is the environment. Fewer people means less polluted air. The fossil fuels can also be used for more generations without being depleted and give the people a higher living standard. Housing would be a lot cheaper with fewer people since more free land for everyone. Here again we can compare China to Sweden or why not Canada/USA. Housing in big cities in China are more expensive than a mansion in USA because of not enough free space.\\n\\nExplain to me why the AVERAGE person benefits from an increasing population like many economists say? I never understood this for above reasons. Sure, the overall BNP will grow and CEO\\'s will make higher profits because more people will buy their stuff, but the average person would have a worse time. Hence why I think the population of the world should decrease a lot so everyone can enjoy a decent standard of living without killing this planet.

The reasons why I the reasons why I think this practice is detrimental to open-mindedness are multitudinous:  \\n\\n* Firstly the strength of an argument typically has more to do with the talent of the debater in question, or the amount of diligence they put into their work, than the actual evidence itself.   Flashier, or more witty evidence presents itself as more prevalent than equally valid, but more mundane evidence.  This, of course, is a generalization, but for most people and most circumstances, I find it holds true.\\n\\n* In the same capacity, debating something also lends false credibility to each side of the argument.  Suffused within the notion of debate is the notion that there is no such thing as an \"entirely fallacious\" argument, for example.  Or rather, the notion that every viewpoint - no matter how absurd or fallacious - is equally defensible in a debate.  An open-minded individual should (hypothetically) be able to research both sides of an argument, and come to their conclusions based upon that research.\\n\\n* If my previous two claims are untrue, then, AT BEST, a debate can be seen as a way to save time, and nothing else.  Conceivably, if the talent or diligence of a debater is irrelevant, and if any side of an argument is defensible, then all that a debate really does is save each side the time of having to research the other point of view for themselves.\\n\\n* Finally, though the inherently competitive nature of humankind can take a backstage, it can never be completely ignored.  In a format like a debate, even the most reserved and controlled individual will have some base impulse to \"win\" - and that impulse gets in the way of true open-mindedness.   Even if all that the impulse to \"win\" does is make one opponent harder to convince of the flaws in his/her argument, that difficulty would be a result of something entirely unrelated to the truth of the matter, and therefor would be irrelevant/close-minded.  \\n\\nPlease note:   I am not pointing to another alternative form of discourse as preferential - merely pointing out the flaws in the practice of debate.   \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Let\\'s take apart the meaning of that statement. Interpreted in anything resembling a sensible fashion, it doesn\\'t mean that *any* means is justified for carrying out *any* goal someone could possibly have in mind. It means only that, *if* a given end is justified, the *necessary* means for carrying it out must necessarily be justified.\\n\\nThis should not be any more controversial than \"If A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C.\" Nevertheless, somehow, it is.\\n\\nAll of the archetypical bad results of \"the end justifies the means\" fall under three cateogories: a) it\\'s not actually a good end, b) it\\'s not a means that achieves the good end, c) it is a means, but a bad one in the face of alternative possible means. For example:\\n\\n* A communist guerrilla wants to blow up a military base in order to achieve the revolution. Taking for granted that this would be the best way to achieve that end, is he justified? Not if communism is not, in fact, a good end. If communism is evil, then not only is he not justified in blowing up the base, he\\'s not even morally justified in writing a book talking about how great communism is (which is probably more helpful to his cause in the long run).\\n* Someone thinks the U.S. is behaving unjustly toward illegal immigrants. For example, the president could do more to stop people from being deported. Therefore, he decides to assassinate the president as an example, in order to stop the injustice. It\\'s a good end (let\\'s just grant this), but does it justify the means? No, because it\\'s a *terrible* means! It would almost certainly have the opposite effect, encouraging much greater severity towards illegal immigrants.\\n* Making money is generally held to be a good end. Therefore, someone decides to rob a bank in order to make some money. Is he justified? No, because while robbing banks is a way to make money (in the short term), it has very many other negative effects that outweigh the money obtained—plus, there are other ways to make money. If it were between robbing banks and starvation, there would be a decent case, but our robber could also get a job or apply for welfare in order to get the money he needs.\\n\\n**Trolley Madness**\\n\\nThe only point where this appears to break down even for a second is when people start using crazy hypotheticals, usually about trolleys. For example, there is the very famous one where you see a trolley about to go under the bridge you are standing on, where it will kill five people tied to the tracks. But there is also a very fat man on the bridge! If you push him off, his body will derail the trolley, and the five people will be saved. Of course, the fat man will die.\\n\\nThis is where the people who don\\'t believe that \"the end justifies the means\" jump in and say: \"Aha! If that saying were true, you should push the fat man, since five lives are greater than one. But that would be murder! So something is wrong with that saying.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, of course, five lives are not necessarily greater than one, depending on who they are—but let\\'s just ignore that. Let\\'s say that, by whatever moral standard you\\'re using, the five people\\'s lives are definitely more important either to you or to society.\\n\\nStill, there is a pretty obvious reason why pushing the fat man might still be wrong: if people were allowed to kill innocent people whenever, in their own judgment, it might bring about the greater good, it is quite likely that they would abuse this power! In the long run and in the real world, it is better to live by the principle of \"don\\'t intentionally kill innocent people\" than to look around trying to see if some fat guys are big enough to derail a trolley. That is, fewer innocent people will die if we rigidly stick to that principle than if we hunt around for edge cases.\\n\\n**Consequentialism**\\n\\nPhilosophically, the broader application of the principle that \"the end justifies the means\" is called *consequentialism*. That is, when we are deciding whether something is good or bad, we should look at the consequences of it, not at some arbitrary rule. It is generally opposed to *deontology*, which says that things are good or bad because they correspond (or not) with some system of rules—which are not adopted in order to achieve any ulterior purpose. As you can tell, I think deontology is absurd: it fetishizes \"the rules\" as ends in themselves, instead of means to a greater end.\\n\\nOf course, there are many moral systems that are all filed under consequentialism, depending on what consequence it is that they hold as the ultimate end. For example, three of the most famous:\\n\\n* Ethical egoism, which says that the moral thing to do is that which results in the greatest benefit for yourself.\\n* Ethical altruism, which says that the moral thing to do is that which results in the greatest benefit for others, ignoring yourself.\\n* Utilitarianism, which says that the moral thing to do is that which results in the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people (including yourself, but since you are only 1/7 billion, the classical form of utilitarianism effectively amounts to altruism). Classical ulititarianism is also hedonistic, meaning that the only fundamentally good and bad things are pleasure and pain, respectively.\\n\\nSo accepting only consequentialism by no means solves all debate over ethics, but it does at least eliminate some particularly wrong-headed systems.\\n\\nFurthermore, consequentialism (as I tried to show in the trolley example) does not exclude the possibility of acting on principle. The principles are, of course \"only\" means to an end, but it is quite likely that sticking to firm principles will have better consequences in the long run than a sort of naive \"pragmatism\" that treats every case in isolation based on the short-term information available.\\n\\nThis is the part where I\\'m supposed to present some counter-arguments to consequentialism, but honestly I can\\'t think of anything halfway decent that doesn\\'t just appeal to some alleged negative consequence of consequentialism—making it self-refuting.\\n\\nFor example, there\\'s the age-old \"morality is what God said it is in [sacred text], period.\" (Taking the hard line in the[ Euthyphro dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma).) So why should we follow it? You can\\'t say: \"Because if you do, you will be happy,\" or \"Because if you don\\'t, you will go to hell,\" because now you\\'re appealing to consequences (and implying that you ought to do things because they\\'re what\\'s best for you, which is ethical egoism).\\n\\nEvery other objection works the same way, as I see it. Either the advocates of non-consequentialism have to appeal to consequences, or else there is no coherent reason to obey their rules.\\n\\nFinally, I do want to give credit to Scott Alexander\\'s [Consequentialism FAQ](http://www.raikoth.net/consequentialism.html) for prompting me to write this. I disagree with a lot of his views (including his moral intuitionism and utilitarianism), but it does hammer home that deontology is absurd.\\n\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That just amounts to making it worse more slowly, which is still making it worse.  Of course we should cut emissions, to avoid make the solution (whatever it might be) harder than it already is.  But we shouldn\\'t pretend that making it worse more slowly is a solution.  \\n\\nAdaptation will be part of the response too.  We\\'re changing the climate, and we\\'re going to have to adjust to the results.  But again, it\\'s not exactly a solution.  We can do better.\\n\\nThen there\\'s geoengineering.  That currently comes in two flavors: decreasing absorption of sunlight at Earth\\'s surface, and removing some CO2 from the atmosphere.  Both are plausible options, and should be researched much more than they are now, and put in place where and as they\\'re cost-effective.  But there\\'s a third geoengineering option, which gets no attention: fussing with winds and ocean currents.  And my hunch is that the third option will be better.\\n\\nWeather is chaotic.  It\\'s unpredictable, over a time scale longer than a couple weeks.  It\\'s not just that it\\'s a huge computing challenge.  \\n\\nIt is a huge computing challenge: the sheer amount of data needed is so large that we have to leave out a lot of detail that does matter.  But computers have improved to the point where weather forecasts are pretty good over the time range where they\\'re possible.  \\n\\nThe computing task is daunting, but that\\'s not why it\\'s impossible to forecast weather beyond a couple weeks.  It\\'s impossible to forecast weather beyond a couple weeks because, given two slightly-different initial states of the atmosphere (and distribution of ocean-surface temperature, and of temperature and moisture on the ground, but for simplicity let\\'s just call it \"states of the atmosphere\"), the difference in the resulting states of the atmosphere grows exponentially with time.  It\\'s the proverbial butterfly effect: the initial difference might be the flap of a butterfly\\'s wing, but after the two versions have been progressing for a month or two, one might have a tornado where the other has a clear sky.  But it doesn\\'t have to be a butterfly.  It can be us.  Suitably chosen small interventions will make big differences after a few weeks.  \\n\\nIt won\\'t be anything like control: the outcomes have to be among the basic range of possibilities.  But there are differences that matter, within that range.  It\\'s as though we\\'re betting at the same craps table, but every third game or so we see a chance to weight the dice.  Conventional geoengineering involves a lot of work everywhere, to tweak the probabilities over the whole table.  Adaptation adjusts the payouts.  Circulation geoengineering makes a tiny change at just the right time and place, when the opportunity arises.\\n\\nIt\\'s a complicated situation, not just the roll of a simple die.  So there are many ways we may be able to intervene.\\n\\nA key concept to understand is the Coriolis effect.  Wind moves in response to pressure differences.  Where the pressure is higher, that pushes air toward places where the pressure is lower.  But that\\'s not the direction the wind blows.  Matter in motion tends to keep going the same direction; it takes a force to change it.  As the planet rotates on its axis, the wind tries to keep going the same absolute direction, not the same direction relative to the earth.  In our rotating perspective, it veers off to the side.  It keeps doing so until the pressure gradient exactly balances the Coriolis force, and wind flows along isobars (lines of equal pressure) instead of from high pressure to low.  \\n\\nThat theoretical condition is called the geostrophic wind.  Temperature differences drive the wind by creating pressure differences pushing in the direction that would transport heat, and the geostrophic wind blows crosswise to that.  So given a constant temperature distribution on the ground, the geostrophic wind wouldn\\'t transport any heat.  There are a number of differences between real winds and the geostrophic wind, but the main one is drag.  Drag makes the wind slower than geostrophic, so some air can flow down the pressure gradient.\\n\\nSo if we want heat transported, all we have to do is create drag.  Our inteverntions don\\'t have to do any work: the wind would do work on them.\\n\\nThere\\'s hardly any drag more than a hundred meters or so above the ground.  So modest drag from [airborne wind turbines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_wind_turbine) could make a big relative difference.  Airborne wind turbines are in a relatively early stage of development, but their promoters claim they would be cost-competitive with other sources of energy.  If so, the intervention might even pay for itself.\\n\\nThere\\'s more I could say, such as about the transport of moisture and using snow cover to affect albedo, but I\\'m getting long-winded already.\\n\\n Thank you!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I’ve been playing since January of 2007 (circa Lorwyn Block), and my first deck was the Selesnya United Pre-Con. I’m an avid reader of the weekly columns posted on the WotC website. \\n\\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Magic: The Gathering, I would direct you to [this page]( http://magic.wizards.com/en/what-is-magic) to find out more about the game. If you’ve never played the game before, I would summarize it as follows: \\n\\n**(If you are already familiar with Magic: The Gathering, you can skip the next three paragraphs)**\\n\\nYou and at least one other player start the game with 20 life. Each of you brings your own deck of cards to the game. A deck of cards will (most often) be composed of a mixture of lands, creature spells, and non-creature spells. Lands produce mana. Mana is needed to cast spells. The most common way of winning the game is by attacking your opponent with creatures. The goal of the game (in general) is to bring your opponent’s life total to zero before they do the same to you. There are other ways to win; however, this is the most common. \\n\\nTapping a permanent (land, creature, or otherwise) is the in-game mechanic used to represent that you are “using” that permanent. When you tap a card, you turn it sideways. If you tap a land, it produces mana of the designated color. If you tap a creature, you are either attacking, activating an ability, or tapping the creature as the cost of another spell or ability. In short, the state of being “tapped” represents that the creature (or permanent) is “used,” “exhausted,” or otherwise, no longer usable. \\n\\nOne final note about creatures: The rule in Magic: The Gathering is that creatures cannot attack or tap to activate an ability on the turn that they enter the battlefield. The antiquated term for this “state” is called “summoning sickness.”\\n\\nMy argument is very simple. I believe that, **from the start of the game, the game should have been designed such that creatures entered the battlefield tapped, and they tap to block.**\\n\\nI have taught this game to many new players in my years of playing, and, in my opinion, I’ve gotten very good at teaching the basics in a way that is easily understood and most frequently makes the new player want to play again. For those of you who have ever taught the game before, you know that this can sometimes be challenging, as the game’s complexity can be very overwhelming to new players and pushes them away. \\n\\nThe most common assumptions that new players make while playing are:\\n\\n* They put the creature onto the battlefield tapped.\\n* They tap the creature to block.\\n* They try to attack with a creature that just entered the battlefield.\\n* They think that an untapped creature that entered the battlefield since their last turn (AKA a creature with summon sickness) cannot block.  \\n\\nSeeing that this is so common among new players, it inspired me to imagine what the game would be like if creatures entered the battlefield tapped and tapped to block. Having considered what the game would be like if that were the case, I think that it would have been much more intuitive and much better for the game in the long run if that had been the case from the start. \\n\\nSince these are really two separate arguments, I will break them down as such.\\n\\n**Creatures should have always entered the battlefield tapped**\\n\\n*Fundamental changes in how the game would be played:* \\n\\nA) It means that creatures cannot block the turn that they come into play. I am fully aware that this is the biggest, and most impactful, change to the game as it is right now. However, given that creatures have never been able to attack the turn they come into play (barring haste), *the game has always been designed with this in mind.* Players are used to this fact and understand it. The same could be true for blocking. *If creatures had always entered the battlefield tapped, players wouldn’t have known any differently.* \\n\\nB) Creatures that were “flickered” (removed from the game and returned to play) would return to the battlefield tapped. This means that players couldn’t use flickering as a combat trick to otherwise untap a tapped creature.\\n\\nC) The keyword “Haste” would function slightly differently (but more intuitively, in my opinion). Instead of saying “this creature can attack and {T} no matter when it came under your control” (which is the current reminder text for haste), all it needs to say is “This creature enters the battlefield untapped.” If it enters untapped, it can be used immediately. Intuitive.\\n\\n**Creatures should have always tapped to block**\\n\\n*Fundamental changes in how the game would be played:* \\n\\nA) It means that creatures cannot block *and* activate abilities that require tapping. Many experienced players would consider this a drawback; however, I don’t see this as very different from changing combat damage to no longer using the stack. It makes sense that players cannot put combat damage on the stack, activate an ability (maybe even one that removes the creature from the battlefield), and then still have combat damage go through. The same would be true for blocking. It makes sense that a creature cannot block *and* do something else. \\n\\nB) The keyword “Vigilance” would function slightly differently (but consistently). Instead of saying “Attacking doesn't cause this creature to tap” (which is the current reminder text for vigilance), all it needs to say is “Attacking and blocking doesn’t cause this creature to tap.” This keeps the keyword consistent and intuitive.\\n\\n**Pros:**\\n\\nA) This lessens the barrier to entry for new players. The state of being tapped represents that a creature is unusuable. What the creature can and cannot do is simply dictated by its state. If it is tapped, it’s unusable. If it’s untapped, you can use it.\\n\\nB) The rewording of haste is intuitive, and also lessens the word count on [Act of Treason]( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386470) style effects. Instead of having to say “Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.” all you have to say is “Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature.” It lowers the comprehension complexity of a number of cards and effects that need haste. \\n\\nC) The minor change to vigilance is negligible, and maintains consistency.  \\n\\nD) Players can’t block *and* activate abilities that require tapping. I know that many players would disagree with me here, but I see this as a benefit. Similar to how combat damage no longer uses the stack, you can’t have creatures block *and* do something else. It makes a lot of sense.\\n\\nAdditionally, this lowers board complexity. If I want to attack you, and you control a [Nightfall Predator]( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222118), I don’t have to track the damage from combat and the damage from fighting. You only have the option of doing one of those things. Again, this lowers the barrier to entry for new players.\\n\\nE) I think there could be a lot of design space opened up by having creatures tap to block. You could do a lot more with vigilance as a mechanic if it also meant that creatures don’t tap to block. Alternatively, vigilance could still be worded to say that only attacking does not cause the creature to tap, which means that you could create a new keyword for blocking. \\n\\n**Cons:**\\n\\nA) Players can’t block *and* activate abilities that require tapping. Yes, I know that I already listed this as a pro, but I also see this as a con. Part of what makes Magic so exciting and enriching is the potential to discover new ways to use cards. Mark Rosewater calls this “Lenticular Design.” By not allowing creatures to block *and* use activated abilities that require tapping, you reduce the potential for players to discover new strategies that are possible and that allow critical moments of “Crystallization” with the game. \\n\\nHowever, I feel that this can be turned into a pro by changing how those activated abilities are activated. If they are not abilities that require tapping, the creature can still block and activate its abilities. The problem with this solution is that, by not requiring tapping to activate, you can activate an ability as many times as you want. If you wanted to limit how many uses a player could have, you’d have to set a cap on the number of times an ability could be activated per turn. \\n\\nB) Untapping becomes much more valuable. [Twiddle]( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45235) style effects become much more potent; However, if this was the case from the start, then untapping effects would be designed very carefully around this feature. \\n\\nC) The “untap” mechanic from Shadowmoor/Eventide becomes very problematic. However, if this was the way things always were, then the untap mechanic may not have ever been created (or if it were, it would be very carefully crafted around this feature). \\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nIn summary, I think that if creatures entered the battlefield tapped and tapped to block, it would be easier for new players to grasp, consistent with attacking, and limit the potential to abuse activated abilities similar to the way they could when combat damage still used the stack. \\n\\nOne final note before we begin: *Please be aware that in no way am I suggesting that this is a change that should be made now.* The game has been designed under the premise that creatures enter untapped for 20 years. Far too many cards and mechanics have been designed with this in mind. Changing that would drastically alter the way the game is played now, and it would ruin it for too many people. What I am proposing is that *this is how it always should have been,* and that if that were the case, *many of the ways that the game currently exists would be different,* but better for the overall health of the game and satisfaction of the players.\\n\\nChange my view. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The message I read loud and clear was: \\n\\n    women don\\'t like it when you make sexual advances on them, and if you do you could be sued\\n\\nUntil my mid 20\\'s I was so afraid that doing anything to persue a girl I was interested in would be unwanted or inappropriate that all the girls I dated basically had to hit me over the head and drag me back to their cave.\\n\\nI\\'m sure I\\'m not alone in this - I think there are a generation of guys who have been confused by this message, and are so concerned with being respectful of women that they\\'re discouraged from making even appropriate, wanted advances toward interested potential partners.\\n\\nI\\'m worried that the current discussion around cat-calling could be having the same effect on the boys of a certain age right now.

This could be post office/UPS (the post office in USA loses tons of money, has too many stores, etc.), public works for cities VS independent salting/road repair companies, or even the entirety of the US military VS Blackwater (Blackwater never had a single failed mission in Iraq).  These are just some examples I can think of at the moment, but it seems like every time the government attempts to provide a material, money-handling service, they do a very poor job at keeping it efficient.

Similarly, studies on smoking do not differentiate between someone who smokes thrice a day and someone who smokes multiple packs a day, and that\\'s as disingenuous as comparing someone who drinks a cup of wine a night and someone who is an alcoholic. Because I keep a great diet of natural food and exercise, as well as no soda and limited alcohol, I don\\'t think I\\'m even at risk if I keep smoking until I\\'m *40*. Pardon these edges for a moment, but American society as a whole offers praise to football players who are at a high risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders and arthritis, and yet demonizing smokers whose risks are similar. \\n\\nI\\'ve never felt addicted to smoking. I\\'ve never woken up and demanded a cigarette, like I used to do when I was addicted to WoW. I remember literally crying on a family vacation because I was unable to play WoW. I wound up resorting to this [shitty murloc flash game](http://www.flashgames247.com/play/661.html) in a desperate hope to satiate my addiction. This is not how I feel about tobacco. \\n\\n*\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied.

I could give a fuck about theology and dogmatic tradition. What I care about is the philosophical core of religion: understanding and bringing about religious experience. \\n\\nThe first thing that brings me to this idea is that, contrary to popular belief, science in no way has ever claimed it was truth. People have decided that it was, but all science does is create a model to make predictions. If those predictions work, then we can create tools with the model. We know very well that quantum mechanics and relativity theory are not \"true\" because they are incompatible. What they do is allow us to make predictions and therefore tools. These tools have helped us out, no doubt. But I believe that we need to shift our entire way of thinking from an understanding nature to an experiential nature. My favorite scientist, Werner Heisenberg, has this to say about it:\\n\\n\"The existing scientific concepts cover always only a very limited part of reality, and the other part that has not yet been understood is infinite.\"\\n\\nThe other part is infinite. We can either keep going down a path of trying to figure out this fractal-like void of knowledge, which we are not capable in the least of doing biologically, or we can try to *experience* rather than *understand* our existence. This is done through the study of religions. \\n\\nReligions are all an attempt to explain an experience or set of experiences that people have. This includes Judeo-Christian, Pagan, Eastern, any sort of thought. What they are all attempting to do, at their core, is bring about the experience of something. Judeo-Christian thought wants to bring about heaven, and as Jesus says in the Gospel of Thomas (which is just as legitimate as any other text) the kingdom of heaven is here. The Qu\\'ran says turn your head in every direction and there you see the face of Allah. Buddhism speaks of Nirvana, Hinduism speaks of Moksha, Taoism of the sage, all of these are experiences of the one-like nature of the universe. That brings us back to Heisenberg\\n\\n\"There is a fundamental error in separating the parts from the whole, the mistake of atomizing what should not be atomized. Unity and complementarity constitute reality.\"\\n\\nScience, religion, they all talk about the unity. What we cannot do, according to Heisenberg and science, is understand. We can, as he says \"speak of it in images and parables.\" Sounds a lot like religion. We can understand that the big picture is completely unfathomable, and realize that what we really should do is *experience* the big picture through the study of religion. Maybe this is Judeo-Christian charity. Maybe this is Eastern meditation. Maybe its a good fuck or a nice view or dancing around. I don\\'t care what your method of experience is, but religions are the study of this experience. They provide ways to bring about the experience. These experiences are just as \"real\" as anything else. \\n\\nYou simply cannot say that I have not had religious, unexplainable (other than what I would call magic) experiences with the love of my life on top of a skyscraper in Tokyo 15,000 miles away from home. You cannot say that Ayrton Senna did not \"see god\" as he says all the time about him winning F1 races. You cannot say that someone dancing around losing themselves completely on acid at a Grateful Dead show did not have an unexplainable religious experience. These experiences are all real, and are all attempted to be explained by religious studies. Maybe Senna did not see a Christian god. But he had a religious experience, he experienced *something* and attempted to explain it with is home tradition that he had heard his entire life. The academic study of religion is important to this entire realm of experience. We need to study these experiences, and maybe even make them our goal as a culture. \\n\\nI am not saying science sucks and we should abandon it. It creates great tools and has helped us immensely. But it is an upaya, (in the Buddhist term) a tool. It is a great thing, but we cannot lose sight of the equally sized realm of experience that is studied through religion. Religious study is also upaya, and we should use it where it is helpful. A final quote from Heisenberg: \\n\\n“The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.” \\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I am always searching for opportunities to automate tedious and repetitive parts of my job, and I try to completely avoid taking on projects that have a low return compared to their workload.\\n\\nOut of principle, I never work more longer than a 40 hour week unless it\\'s a real emergency.\\n\\nSo far I\\'ve done OK. I\\'m an engineer and most of my jobs are 1-2 year contracts for large corporations. I\\'m not high up the corporate ladder but the salary is high enough to cover all my material needs plus save about 30% for retirement.\\n\\n**1**- I know that if I worked a lot harder, I would have the chance to be promoted to a director position, but I don\\'t see the point. The net wage would be 20-30% higher, but I would have to sacrifice more than 30% of my time&amp;energy for the corporation.  Also, in my field director positions seem less safe than manager positions. Directors cost more and are the first people to be laid off when there is a restructuring.\\n\\n**2**- I cannot take my achievements to the grave.  To me, life is not about achievements but about experiences. Achievements are just a means to an end, which is having awesome experiences. There is a case to be made that social status itself is an \"experience\" worth pursuing, but corporate titles don\\'t really impress the people closest to me. They only impress people I don\\'t like and don\\'t care about. \\n\\n**3**- There certainly are situations where hard work is worth it, but working for a corporation is not one of them. Most of the fruits of your labor will go to the shareholders and not to your salary.  For an employee, the returns diminish very sharply in the corporate word.\\n\\n**4**- A higher position *can* mean more autonomy, but it also means managing people which is not something I enjoy. And since I do mostly contract work I already have some autonomy in choosing the projects I will work on.\\n\\nHaving said all that, I cannot get rid of the feeling that I\\'m somehow letting myself down. Rationally it all makes sense, but emotionally there is still my dad\\'s voice in my head telling me that I should work hard.

In order to combat this problem, each side in a legal battle should be forced to contribute equal money to their own counsel and their opponents counsel.',\n  'delta_label': True,\n  'name': 't3_2lhzxl',\n  'selftext': \"There are two parts to this view, and I will award deltas if you can change either of them. The first is that money in courts is a fundamental miscarriage of justice. When I see cases where a drunk kid kills people, but their rich parents get them off with their crack team of lawyers, or a powerful corporation destroys a regular person or small business with a costly court case on extremely weak grounds because the small business can't afford to fight back, I am sickened. Equality in the eyes of the law is in my opinion the single most important part of our society, and in the current system, the rich and the poor are not equal in the eyes of the law.\\n\\nThe second part of my view is that a good solution to this problem is to require that both sides in a lawsuit or court case contribute equally to their own legal team and their opponents. I've thought long and hard about this, and this is the best thing I can come up with. Other attempts to bring equality to courts that I've seen all fall short somewhere. The loser paying the winner's legal fees doesn't help, because it only takes place after the end of the lawsuit, and large corporations win by dragging on a suit until the small business runs out of money and has to give up. Preventing money from entering the courts in the first place doesn't work, because some issues actually are complex and nuanced and require lots of lawyer's time to analyse. Having each party contribute equally to their own and their opponents legal fees ensures that complex cases can be sorted out as long as one party is willing to pay for it, it ensures that both sides are equal in the eyes of the law, and it solves the problems I brought up earlier. In the case of he rich parents paying to get their drunk-driving son off easy, they would be forced to contribute an equal amount to the state's case, allowing the state to effectively fight back, and it prevents large corporations bleeding small entities dry, because the small entities aren't using their own money anymore.\\n\\nEssentially, the legal system has in some cases been turned into a weapon, and this proposal would turn it back into what it should be: a way to determine wrongdoing.\\n\\nOne note: Don't try to change my view that this can't be done because it is a restriction on freedom without first trying to convince me that freedom is more important than equality. I believe that equality is more important than freedom and I'm totally willing reduce freedom in exchange for an increase in equality, within reason.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I keep expecting people to be as engrossed in the videogame market as I am, and I\\'m assuming too much on the part of the average reader. A while ago when Sims 3 came out a lot of people hated it, and hated EA for how poorly it ran, and all that jazz, you remember. So as a response they came out with a video on youtube about how they don\\'t discriminate. It featured a bunch of characters from their respective games having a sex with each other Like Shepard and Kaiden, or two males sims, something like that. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHY WE WERE MAD AT THEM. THEIR GAME RAN LIKE SHIT so they used a hot topic like gay marriage to make pander to the masses. \\n\\nEDIT 6: Lets talk about Marijuana for a second because it serves for a good analogy. Its a hot topic right now; widely debated. I make a videogame and I\\'m like BTW guys My character smokes weed! Unless it has something to do with the plot, I\\'m pandering to people who smoke solely for the sake of getting more money from them. Not to advance any agenda or right any social wrong.\\n\\nSo recently a lot of games have been adding homosexual characters to their games, and while not inherently wrong, cheapens the quality of a game as a whole. Sexuality should never come into play, unless it is a core element of the story or lore of a game. By now heterosexuality is still considered \"normal\" and a basic love arc between two characters of opposite gender isn\\'t something someone bats an eye at. A good story about two gay or lesbian characters can be something really great, especially with the backdrop of a society that abhors them. It makes for really good writing. Now I\\'m not gay, but I\\'ve found some gay character\\'s stories especially touching when it comes to unrequited love. It really strengthens the character and the story as a whole as seen with someone like Dumbledore, or a certain character from A Dance with Dragons. The addition of a gay characters just for the sake of them is just shameless pandering. Politics should be left to the real world. Stories are an art, and should be treated as such. Any pandering would ruin a story, but I guess I picked this one because its such a hot topic and I would like to get a discussion on it. LOOK AT ME PANDER IN REAL-TIME. \\n\\nEDIT: The most important things is the story. He\\'s a non-sexual way to look at it. Borderlands 2 uses memes absolutely fucking shamelessly NOT because its relevant to the plot, but to pander to YOU, a redditor. Its just as disgusting. The point is the story. The story, the story, the story. Not yours or my political beliefs. I knew that some of you were going to get touchy about this, but lets get one thing straight. I HAVE GAY FRIENDS. THIS IS AN INSULT TO THEM.\\n\\nEDIT 2: I\\'m actively pandering to reddit right now because I labeled this thread to make it about homosexuality. I\\'m using the sensitivity of this subject to strike up a conversation about pandering in general. Let\\'s get one thing clear: Race, gender, and anything else about people you can know just by looking at them are not what I\\'m talking about and are not good analogies. Its the fact that videogame companies use hot topics currently happening that should be abhorred. It doesn\\'t help the game. ANYTHING. ANY SEXUALITY WHATSOEVER. ANY TOPIC WHATSOEVER, UNLESS RELEVANT TO THE PLOT, OR TO HELP DEEPEN THE LORE IS OBSOLETE AND IF ITS SOLELY THERE TO PANDER THEN IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING TO BE ASHAMED OF. I do not hate gays. I do not hate lesbians. I am using this topic to pander to you. See how it feels? I\\'m explicitly using a hot topic to advance my own view of \"Nothing is more important than the story\".\\n\\nEDIT 3: I\\'m getting a lot of repeat questions. Anyway I don\\'t feel like these people are trying to advance any part of the LGBT community in anyway. They are just shoehorning gay characters in to make money. No I don\\'t think being gay shouldn\\'t be brought up at all. Jon Connington\\'s story in A Dance with Dragons is heart-wrenching and I\\'m glad its in the book. Its clear to me that George R.R. Martin put that in his story to help advance the plot and deepen his character. NOT get more money from gays and lesbians.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

As a matter of fact, I think this is worse than a child born of incest because it is much more likely to harm the child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore recently I actually thought this was a no-brainer, but I was just banned from a subreddit just for agreeing with an article that discussed the topic. While the banning itself was just poor moderation, I was concerned with all of the opposition I was getting from other posters.\\n\\n**EDIT**: I should have clarified more how it would be enforceable. As several had mentioned, It would be very difficult to catch a mother in the act of drinking if she was determined to do so. [This case in the UK] suggests that a mother who drinks during pregnancy and causes FAS in a child would owe that child compensation. This would would at least set the precedent that it is a crime, and the mother will be held responsible for knowingly harming her child.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, most change in language makes things more clear by adding new terms for things that people need to describe.\\n\\nUsing \"literally\" wrong does the opposite.  It renders the word meaningless, creates a lexical gap, and makes the English language that much less clear.\\n\\nFor clarity\\'s sake, I\\'m going to be talking about two definitions.  The right or original definition of \"literally\" means \"not in metaphor nor figuratively.\"  The wrong or new definition of literally I\\'m referring to is the opposite; \"metaphorically, or figuratively.\"  I\\'m paraphrasing slightly [from the dictionary definitions](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literally) but keeping the spirit.\\n\\nThe reason that the wrong definition is so bad is that it means the negation of the right definition.  And when somebody uses the word \"literally\", it\\'s unclear whether they\\'re talking about the original definition or the new definition.  \\n\\nSo when someone says, for example **\"my friend literally stabbed me in the back,\"** it either means \"my friend stabbed me in the back, and I don\\'t mean that as a figure of speech but rather that they placed a literal knife into my back.\" (with the original definition) or they mean \"my friend stabbed me in the back, but in a figurative way.  They didn\\'t really put a knife into my back.\" (with the new definition).  Since it\\'s unclear, the sentence essentially means (to the listener), \"my friend stabbed me in the back, and that either is a figure of speech or it isn\\'t.\"  The problem is that the last part, \"that is a figure or speech or it isn\\'t\" is true and always implied whether you say or not.  In that sense, this sentence means the same thing as \"my friend stabbed me in the back.\"  The word \"literally\" adds no new information and doesn\\'t make the sentence any clearer.  It is rendered useless.\\n\\nAnd since it\\'s rendered useless, that creates a lexical gap.  The word \"literally\" (in its correct definition) was a very useful word.  Often times, you can find yourself describing something that sounds like a metaphor or a figure of speech, but did literally happen.  And the word \"literally\" is useful for letting people know that it isn\\'t a figure of speech, without having to go through the tedium of saying \"and I don\\'t just mean that as a figure of speech/metaphor.\"  There is no other word that fills this purpose now, and the English language is poorer and less clear for its loss.\\n\\nMost changes and evolutions in language don\\'t have this problem.  CMV.\\n\\n**EDIT**:\\n\\nResponses to common arguments:\\n\\n*  \"It will be clear from context which definition people mean.\"  If it\\'s clear from context whether they mean a literal \"literally\" or a new definition \"literally\", then it would also be clear without the word \"literally\" there at all.  The word is still adding no information to the sentence.  However, in those situations where it is *unclear* whether someone us using a figure of speech or not, the word \"literally\" will make things clear, only if it just has the one meaning.\\n\\n*  \"Literally is an intensifier; it doesn\\'t mean non-literally.\"  This is another way of looking at it, but it doesn\\'t really disprove the over-all point I\\'m making.  If  \"literally\" has another meaning as an intensifier, then it is still going to be unclear which one you\\'re using in pretty much any sentence where it would be unclear if it means \"non-literal,\" since an intensifier can be added to pretty much any sentence.  It\\'s still making things unclear; just in a different way.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I think many (most?) of us have a strong emotional reaction to witnessing a fellow citizen break a rule of some sort, depending on the situation, and the subconscious reasons why are interesting to me. So here we go...\\n\\n**Area Description:** I was stuck in traffic on the freeway off ramp that I exit the freeway on every morning. The off ramp ends with a stop sign before you can merge onto the main street, and the main street traffic has a traffic signal just before the off ramp so if that light is red there are no cars and everybody can exit the freeway off ramp, and when the light is green there are cars passing by and the off ramp gets backed up for a minute or two until the light turns red again. So it\\'s common for the off ramp to be backed up for a minute or two and then immediately clear up.\\n\\n**[Here](http://i.imgur.com/0qcVpau.png) is a diagram.** The blue markings represent car drivers that are following the law. The red marking represents the car driver that committed the moving violation. The green markings represent the main street cross traffic that is present or clear depending on the traffic light just off screen. And the yellow markings are just the cross traffic on the other side of the off ramp. \\n\\n**Moving Violation Description:** So while all the blue cars are stopped and backed up around the curve of the off ramp, one car pulls out from the line of stopped cars and drives around the side of the off ramp next to all the cars, thereby enabling he or she to merge onto the main street (green) traffic without waiting like the rest of us. The off ramp is wide enough to do this without problem; it is a very wide ramp, but there is no question that it is a single lane. It would be damn near impossible to mistake it for two lanes. \\n\\nNow, the blue cars were all stopped because the green cars had oncoming cross traffic. But right when the red car pulled out to jump the line, the green car traffic eased up. Both the red car and the first blue car in line pulled onto the main street at the same time... it being a two lane street so they each pulled into a different lane. The remaining blue cars all pulled onto the main street one by one after that.\\n\\nWhile witnessing this, I was initially upset for a couple of minutes. I wanted to honk and flip him or her off. (I did not.) But upon thinking about it there really isn\\'t any reason for me to be angry about this.\\n\\n**Reasons this shouldn\\'t make me angry:**\\n\\n* Nobody was in danger -- There are absolutely no pedestrians around the area. The red car driver did stop before merging, and only pulled onto the main street once it was clear and safe to do so. The blue cars weren\\'t in danger of being side swiped by the red car as the lane was so wide. **(Edit [7hrs after posting]: I realized something that counters this point of mine and just for fun I\\'ll tell you all.... the red car was blocking the blue car\\'s view of oncoming traffic! That certainly makes it less safe.)**\\n\\n* Nobody got delayed because of it -- All the blue cars were able to merge onto the main street at the same pace they would have if the red car didn\\'t commit this violation. The main street is two lanes, so the red car just took a wide turn into the far lane, so none of the blue cars had to wait for the red car and the red car didn\\'t jump ahead of any of the blue cars.\\n\\n* Yes, he or she did break a rule, but so? -- I\\'m not the type to cling rigidly to rules and be upset about people breaking a rule simply because they broke a rule and defied authority. I\\'m one of those who generally thinks it\\'s okay to break a rule if nobody is harmed. I don\\'t cling to conventions and rules just for the sake of conventions and rules, so that in conjunction with my other two points above should make me not upset by this driver\\'s actions.\\n\\n* Witnessing a person this impatient and frustrated is uncomfortable, but not reason to be angry -- I did realize while thinking about this that one of the reasons it causes such palpable emotions is because what the truth of what I actually witnessed here besides \"driver commits moving violation\" is \"driver becomes so impatient and frustrated that he or she manifests that frustration into action.\" And it is uncomfortable and perhaps even a little scary to witness a person become so upset that they perform actions out of frustration and impatience. But that would be reason for me to feel uncomfortable or scared, not angry. I felt angry. I wanted to honk and flip him off, not run to safety or get away from him. I was angry, not scared.\\n\\nSo, despite the fact that I was angry upon witnessing this, I contend now that there was no justifiable reason for me to be angry... was there?

Personally, I am becoming a vegetarian for moral reasons, so this cmv isn't really an attack on vegetarians but something I am genuinely unsure of myself. \\n\\n\\nWe need to accept two things - universal vegetarianism isn't going to happen soon, and if it happens in the future it will probably be due to good quality lab meet, or some other fundamental changes in society. \\n\\nSecond, an individual not eating meat makes zero difference, almost. Unless you live on a farm or directly hunt your meat, not a single animal is saved. By the time you reject a burger, your rejection pretty much only affects you. \\n\\n\\nHowever that doesn't mean there is no reason to be a vegetarian or to care. One reason is, if you are personally so disturbed by knowing what you are eating that you genuinely don't want meat. That is great, but we can agree that is a personal reason that might help better you as an individual but won't help the world. \\n\\n\\nOnly remaining reason would be contributing to a trend. If restaurants keep getting vegetarian requests they might actually start ordering less meat, and that will culminate and the difference might be felt. However, it is more likely that while they will develop a better vegetatarian offer, the need for meat will only keep increasing with the growing number of population, and contributing to the trend of not eating meat at all won't do any difference. \\n\\n\\nHowever, there is a different trend that many meat eaters are getting behind as well, and that is caring about where your meat is from and whether the animals were ethically treated. Many people aren't able to give up meat, but they do care about animals. If you go behind this trend, you might contribute to making a difference. A restaurant that would otherwise just leave their meat as it is and make a vegetarian option, after hearing enough people ask about where the meat is from, might totally change their meat suppliers. That is a big difference. \\n\\nThe trend would push farms to be more humane if selling otherwise becomes difficult. For a local place, being the fifth regular who cares about this could even be enough to make a difference. \\n\\nIt just seems like the next realistic goal is getting behind demanding better treatment for animals, and that can be achieved if the intended consumers of the meat make these demands. As a vegetarian, you are not the  consumer and therefore you are not of interest to them. You are really only doing it for yourself and not fighting for anything achiavable. By being a meat consumer, your preferences become relevant. \"},\n {'title': 'CMV: That a penis smaller than average can ever be satisfying to most women.',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2lcig4',\n  'selftext': 'As a guy with 4\" length and a thin 4.5\" girth, I\\'ve been rejected and laughed at for my size. 5 times in a row, and it\\'s usually after they see my penis or after sex.

No doubt he was comforted by the same everyday activities we are today: the heat of the fire, good food, his family about him. Can you imagine him laughing and tousling your hair? Can you see him picking up your six month old baby brother and breast feeding him--\"\\n\\n&gt;At this point, the six year-old might burst into tears in sheer confusion. He? Breast feed? \"Don\\'t cry,\" says the teacher. \"It\\'s all right. We all get confused at first. You just have to remember that he really means he or she. See? It\\'s easy!\" But it\\'s not easy. It makes no sense to her. Why say \"he\" when you mean \"she?\" As she grows older, she will keep asking. No one will give her an answer she understands. Her tears of bewilderment will become ones of rage. She will get tired of reading about Man the Hunter, mankind\\'s outward urge to the stars, the exogamous impulses of man, the man on the street, one man one vote.... She will be sick to death of continually being excluded.\\n\\n&gt;\"No, no, no,\" you might say gently, \"she\\'s not being excluded. He is inclusive. He means us all. She\\'ll learn. After all, he is the generic pronoun in English.\"\\n\\n&gt;If that truly were the case, if \"he\" and \"man\" really did mean \"he and she\" and \"man and woman,\" our six year old would not have been confused. But at age six, she has already internalized the real architecture of language; she knows that he means he and she means she. The only thing she doesn\\'t know is how to pretend otherwise, the way grown ups do. She doesn\\'t understand why she shouldn\\'t point out what seems so obvious to her: he-man language isn\\'t wearing any clothes. [link](http://asknicola.blogspot.com/2010/11/humankind-vs-mankind.html)\\n\\nSo again, my CMV is **(TL;DR) that if one is attempting to write a gender-neutral statement about humankind, then one should use a gender-neutral term like \"humankind\" or \"humanity,\" and not the gendered term of \"man\" or \"mankind,\" despite the accepted double meaning of \"man.\"**\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If someone were to talk to me, I assume they would classify me as an atheist, as I do not think that there is a continuation of any sort after death.  Some say that life is important and life matters BECAUSE it ends, which is a beautiful thought in my head; however, I can't get behind it because nothing is permanent.  For example, why does it matter whether someone acts justly and is a good person versus acting vile and offensive?  I'm not saying that we should all be dicks to each other, but what I am saying is that in the long run, there will be no evidence of someone acting either way.  Most people will be completely forgotten within 100 years of their death.  I used to believe that I should strive to be one of the lucky few who should rise above and do something so great that they are remembered indefinitely.  Nowadays, I realize that this was a stupid thought because on a long enough timeline, everything that everyone has ever done will be lost. (When the sun explodes or even if some of us survive that when some sort of cosmic event destroys every part of the universe we are a part of.  OR even simply when the human race becomes extinct or if we evolve when all of the branches of the tree that came from us falls to extinction).  After that, I felt that helping people mattered, because even if I couldn't be remembered, I could still have an effect on people's lives in a positive manner and that has to count for something; however, if everyone who you helped is one day going to be long gone, and every inkling of evidence that you or anyone you ever came into contact with even existed will be gone from the universe, then what is the point?  How does anything matter?\\n\\nThat being said, I recognize that if nothing matters, than perhaps because of that fact, maybe, just maybe, everything is important. Perhaps every single blade of grass, moment in time, leaf in the wind is infact important. This is the point of view that I would like to adopt, but right now, it seems that it takes too much faith and not enough logic for me to take the step into this mindset.  If anyone has this mindset or has someway for me to rationalize this view, please, feel free to comment.\\n\\nLastly, I would like to keep this thread on topic.  I realize that i made certain religious/non-religious assumptions and would not like this to become a religious debate.  Moreover, I recognize that my thoughts here are extremely depressing, but I am not here to debate my psychological state of mind.

Are they rationalizing that Walmart is more evil than my act, so my act is a virtue. The thing about morality, is you may never change anyone's mind. \\n\\nIf you base decisions on scarcity and ask the same questions you will arrive at a better conclusion - hopefully to determine Justice. \\n\\nAnother example is the immorality of eating meat. Again, this needs to be based off of scarcity. You wouldn't call the malnourished immoral. That's roughly 25% of US children. Let's take the next 10 to 20%.

People who support the Redskins team name think it\\'s unfair that people think they should give up their team name just because some people find it offensive.\\n\\nHowever, to me, it seems like demanding to be allowed to be \"politically incorrect\" sounds a lot like asking to be able to insult people without them thinking you\\'re a jerk. \\n\\nPart of having manners is sometimes neglecting your own comfort for the comfort of others. For example, you may like chewing with your mouth open or picking your nose, but you might not want to do that in front of other people because it\\'s gross, and living in society means you have to make some concessions for others. I don\\'t think, if you insisted that you should be able to chew with your mouth open at the dinner table, that you have a right to be offended when no one invites you to dinner parties. \\n\\nSimilarly, if I were to walk up to a stranger and insult their outfit, that person would have every right to think I was an asshole. For me, this is where the \"well, you should be tolerant of my intolerance!\" argument falls apart. Because I don\\'t think unkindness is a thing that should be tolerated.

Not only do i think this is false, i even go as far as to say that *this idea in itself can be dangerous* because this has created people with the notion that they themselves are not responsible for their own health but health professionals thus creating  a mismatch in expectation and responsibility between healthcare workers and clients/patients. *You and you alone* are responsible for your health. You need to educate yourself so you can be critical and challenge your healthcare professional and not blindly follow their opinion.\\n\\nThe internet has almost every information one needs to diagnose a disorder. You just need some guidance which you can also find on the internet. I will give an example of Borderline Personality disorder because that\\'s the disorder i diagnosed myself and later my diagnoses has been confirmed by a psychologist. \\n\\n1. I decided to google some of the things i was distressed about. I came across  emotion regulation disorder which quickly led to BPD. \\n\\n2. At wikipedia i read about the symptoms of BPD. I have 7 out of 9. Continue googleing BPD and read whatever comes up.\\nExperiencing epiphanie after epiphanie. \\n          At this point i\\'m fairly certain i have BPD.\\n\\n3. Take a \" do i have bpd?\" quiz somewhere on the internet. Not surprisingly i have a high chance i have bpd. \\n\\n4. Find stories of people with BPD via Google and /r/BPD (protip: read alltime topposts). Almost anything resonates.\\n\\n5. Buy books about BPD. I read them. I Know 100% that i have bpd after finishing reading the books.\\n\\n6. When i was fairly certain i had bpd (that is before i read the books) i went to see my doctor who send me to a psychologist. When i saw the psychologist i had already read the books. We had an intake conversation and the following 2-3 appointments i took two test that were nowhere near extensive. \\nAt last one conversation with a new psychologist for one hour and at the end of the hour he said that i had bpd.\\n\\nNow things get interesting. The time and effort the psychiatric institution has put in the diagnosis is less than the time and effort i myself put in as far as i can tell. From the very beginning i let them know that i did my research and told them what i knew and how i got the information ( i showed them my books).  It\\'s like they trusted me since the beginning which i very appreciate.\\n\\nNow i don\\'t see what is missing here to form a valid diagnosis. I only missed one symptom which was autistic fantasizing. That symptom that i had didn\\'t come back in my research but i don\\'t think this fact alone undermines the idea of self diagnosis. \\n\\nOf course there are some pitfalls. Some people really want to put a label on themselves so they can avoid taking responsibility for their flaws. I\\'m sure there are others but i think the advantages are more than disadvantages. \\n\\n\\n--------\\n\\nEdit2: I no longer believe that self diagnosis should be encouraged. However, i still hold the view that a layperson can come to a proper self diagnosis in psychological issues. An educated guess is not the most feasible. \\n\\n \\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for participating. There are a couple things that i learned. First that i should be clear that i was primarily referring to mental disorders not biological for obvious reasons (samples, equipment etc.) although i still think in this day and age we should educate ourselves as much as possible and have as clear as possible understanding of whatever we think it\\'s wrong with us. \\n\\nSecond, there was an emphasis on tunnel vision, self delusion and lack of oversight of other possibilities. Laymen supposedly are prone to these pitfalls which i acknowledged in my original post. I\\'m not sure whether this is so common as you guys seem to think. When you search for the symptoms that you suffer from, lots and lots of potential diseases come up. I think the case can be made that someone can get lost in all the vast possibilities, not so much for missing out a potential disease. Someone intelligent enough to understand scientific literature with honest intentions is most likely gonna have an accurate self diagnosis. I and all of us have nothing other than anecdotal evidence for and against this notion. \\n\\nAnyway, i stand by my original stance that self diagnosis is valid and necessary. \\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Sometime egregious misrepresentations of their failing lives. Facebook also facilitates misrepresentations by allowing a user to control every aspect of what\\'s seen, but also subjecting a user to ire of everyone in their circle. In so doing, the circle and ease of manipulation inadvertently puts heavy emphasis, or benefit, to catering to the circle\\'s popular opinion. Also recording of conversations and messages make secrets  harder to keep.  IMO, that means users are more likely to be inauthentic on certain subjects. All for the coup de grace, likes and associates people will never bloom into a real friend.  On the surface all of this seems fun, but then when it comes to deciphering what\\'s real and what isn\\'t, it becomes a bit hazy and a bother for some, and more importantly devalues Facebook.\\n\\n**Twitter**:\\n\\nTwitter is a transient media that  shows breaking news, or happenings very rapidly.  The good thing about twitter is that there\\'s less emphasis placed on connections, more emphasis is places on timely messages or content. So people are more free to say what like, knowing it\\'s probably be forgotten anyway.  Unfortunately, there\\'s more emphasis on comedy, rants, shock value,  than actual info. \\n\\n**Google**:\\n\\nGoogle\\'s value is on the surface on many subjects, but it crumbles when it becomes a source for real information, or when searching things that are unpopular, or when there multitudes of answers to a questions or query. The problem is that there are only a few people that really know anything about most subjects, but Google search is based on popularity, so if other people aren\\'t searching for something you\\'re not going to find it.  This also means that only the popular answers are available for query, but the unpopular ones are not. This seems a bit precarious in some cases, obviously there are many cases that situation doesn\\'t matter. \\n\\n**Reddit**: \\n\\nIt\\'s a bit ironic to use Reddit to talk about how terrible Reddit is, but I guess that\\'s Reddit is for. :)  In a away posting this post Changes My View immediately, however, the one issue that\\'s funny about Reddit ,the same as Google, is that the right answer for many questions is unpopular. The answer mat not be unpopular because people reject it, necessarily, but because it\\'s only known by a few people, and sometimes it is the opposite of conventional wisdom.  So inherently, Reddit is flawed, because all the unpopular opinions are lost, and in some cases not seen. \\n\\nIt\\'s hard to blame any of these media, because sifting through unpopular opinions and deciphering reality, is very difficult.  And one reason why humans still have jobs. Ultimately, all of these media promote creating popular content over unpopular content. So Fundamentally the informational value is challenged, or potentially compromised, because successful distortion of facts holds more value than the truth in many cases. Of course in cases where the truth is only known by few. \\n\\n\\n**EDIT**: A user showed me Google Scholar, cool resource thanks. \\n\\n**Parameters: ** Some people were complaining about moving the goal posts. \\n\\n Each media listed has heavy emphasis on popularity, and in terms entertainment that\\'s the law of the land.  So it\\'s hard to say Facebook, or even Twitter are total abominations. Obviously, the risk of building false connections is the risk, but what doesn\\'t have a risk.  The problem is when think about knowledge or understanding in any arena.  We find that in any subject, or arena, that very few people hold knowledge or understanding of any subject. That would mean that the populous is by in large ignorant.  Google bases it\\'s searches, queries, on popularity.  So fundamentally  Google, and all the others, are flawed for the use of finding \"deep\", or beyond, surface level understanding. Surface, or periphery, understanding is such that there isn\\'t much debate over the information. For example, if drop I apple it will fall to earth.  \\n\\nSome one posted Google Scholar. Still Google Scholar it ranks by cites, which is essentially is popularity. Basing Scholar on cites Google will be better than normal Google for search scholarly articles. But it\\'s still bent towards popularity. \\n\\nEssentially, IMO, that makes Google flawed, but still highly useful. \\n\\n**In order change my view  prove that the use of Popular as metric is a path to deeper understanding. And/Or that use popular as a metric presents no real risk in shunning, or eliminating elements of truth, understanding. ** '},\n {'title': 'CMV: I believe that voluntary vegetarianism and veganism, other than that for religious reasons, is a product of living in the developed world',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2l42m0',\n  'selftext': \"In the developed world, we have a choice as to whether we eat meat.

So, a society has more to gain by exploiting their potential than that of the average student. It stands to reason that those advancing a society the most in science, medicine, or even art are typically those who are the best in those fields. The ones who have the best chances of being the best deserve a program which will help them to do so. \\n\\nSecondly, there is danger in leaving any students unchallenged. It is unhealthy for their motivation and can cause them to be bored in school. It doesn\\'t make too much sense to allow the brightest students to be neglected by not providing them with an education suited to their abilities, because you risk having them become delinquents or underachievers. \\n\\nFinally, societies that promote intellectualism ought to promote Gifted programs. These programs are essentially designed to raise the caliber of one\\'s education, and thus amplify what they are able to take away from it. If we\\'re not promoting Gifted education, then we\\'re effectively encouraging mediocrity. \\n\\nSo CMV, this is what I\\'ve been thinking.

There's been a lot of great stuff said on both sides of the debate. The question has taken two intriguing roads. One is setting up my own con and showing folks how it's done. On one hand, I'd love to. On the other hand... I just want to be able to part of my community without doing all the leg work. And I fear that anything I create will become the same as its sisters after a few years. The other point that is being made is that I should stay in the community simply so someone is fighting for cons to be safer, happier places, and to get what gains I can from the community. And, while I think that is a good argument, so far it hasn't been a compelling one. It's hard to fight and be unpopular and push back and feel hated.\\n\\nOP:\\n\\nI’ve been thinking about this for awhile. Probably a couple of years at the very least. But I kept putting it off because I wanted things to get better, to heal, to change. I worked side-by-side with people that I thought were pushing for a better con community for fans. With a few exceptions, in the nine years I've been working with the con community I've seen:\\n\\n1. More harassment, either verbal or physical.\\n2. More sexually-charged environments, with more children in them.\\n3. More predators using cons as a place to find a cheap dinner.\\n4. More exploitation of fans. (Higher prices for less. Special fees for signings, special premium packages, more fans crammed into the same space, making guests inaccessible, etc.)\\n5. Less support for the emerging artists, authors, actors and 'little people' that are actually what supports a local fanbase.\\n\\nSmall Tomatoes Press has done a lot over the years to support the con community. We've provided prizes and auction items. We've done presentations for several cons. When the  business had to move, we looked into our local options and quickly ran away. It is so toxic. \\n\\nThese cons are hurting people. They are hurting a lot of people as far as I can tell. How many poor underaged girls does con security need to scrap up off the floor of a drunken party before they shut the friggin' parties down? \\n\\nThere are still some very good people involved in the larger con community and some cons have a lot of good people working for them. But they all seem to be fighting the same problems over and over and over. I don’t think it’s getting better because it seems like at every con there are several key players are total creeps. The community seems to accept with varying degrees of disappointment the under aged peep-show vibe and pandering to various special interests groups that have nothing to do with Sci-Fi, Fantasy or Gaming within the con space.  \\n\\nBut the most damning issue is that most cons no longer seem to be for the fans. They've turned into trade shows for companies, actors and authors that serve nerdy tastes. If a big name shows up, it's almost impossible to get face time -- they are surrounded by security and whisked from one monotone panel to the next. Everyone is there to see or be seen. \\n\\nI still have a great deal of affection for my home con, but even it has some struggles in the last few years as it has gotten bigger. \\n\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Simply put, it is allowing horrible, even socially destroying, ideas to be nurtured.\\n\\n\\nAlright, this view is a bit more challengeable I would say and quite more extreme. The current levels of PC/Tolerance are even worse for society than elitism. This is because PC/Tolerance actually causes society to digress instead of progressing. Elitism, I will define it as people being given less leeway for having flaws/not contributing to society. The extreme version would be how the Nazis were elitist in that only Blond Blue Eyed ~~Aztecs (The race they used escapes me at the moment, but it started with A)~~ Aryans! were upheld while all others were seen as inferior, with people with disabilities being persecuted and especially those of other races/religion. That is naturally too extreme however. The elitism I am talking about is elitism of ideas. This would mean a hard crackdown on ideals such as the ISIS, Communism, Anarchy groups and the like as they are threats to society\\'s overall morality and peace of mind. I understand this has problems in itself, especially for those who advocate more \"liberal\" ideals and identities such as LGBT as it promotes close-mindedness but given that the current state of the world, it probably would not affect them too much and probably wouldn\\'t warrant a government crackdown as it doesn\\'t pose an imminent threat to peace or society. The bigger problem I would see is strikes and such movements that protest the government can be labelled as \"disruptive\" but eh, governments seem to do that right now regardless of Tolerance or Political Correctness anyhow. Simply put, the Elitism I describe is more of a society that points out and punishes flaws in the thinking or actions of people compared to the one of now. \\n\\nEdit: Some words. \\n\\nEdit 2: I don\\'t mean all of Europe but generally this is the case for most of it.

Imagine a high-rise condo unit 50-floors tall. The upper floor units have been purchased by a bunch of homeowners. The elevator and bottom floor are owned by a crazed individual named Greg. The tenants of the tower pay Greg a monthly fee to use his elevator. The elevator is the sole method to get from the top of the tower to the bottom. \\n\\nOne day, Greg snaps and goes insane. He refuses to let anybody use his elevator. Instead, he barricades the elevator doors, turns off the elevator function, and traps everyone inside his tower. The elevator is the only way down from the tower. Everyone is trapped in the tower of horror, and they slowly starve to death in a horrible fashion. \\n\\n\\nIn my opinion, Greg\\'s actions are completely within the bounds of \"Natural Rights\" and the motto that \"Your rights end where my nose begins\". Moreover, Greg\\'s actions are also completely within the bounds of the \"Non-aggression Principle\". Greg is free to do what he wants to his own property. He is free to shut down or refuse service to whomever he pleases. \\n\\nThus, according to Right Libertarians, Natural Rights (or Negative Rights) theory, and the Non-aggression Principle, Greg has full authority to shut down the elevator and starve the tenants if he so pleases. Greg has no obligation to preserve any sort of *positive rights* of life. It is not his problem that he has shut down the only means of transit in the tower. \\n\\nThe tenants of the tower, in a Libertarian society, are unjustified in trying to violently coerce Greg to turn the elevator back on. It is well within Greg\\'s  rights to shoot and kill anybody who tries to break into his property to turn the elevator back on and free the tenants. It is within his Rights to barricade his property to prevent anyone from saving the tenants. Greg\\'s decision does not violate the NAP, and thus he has the right to enforce his choice through escalating, proportionate, defensive violence. \\n\\nThe tower tenants are to blame for their own predicament; they were the ones that foolishly agreed to purchase property without properly reading the fine print and realizing that Greg had a monopoly on the elevator. They were the ones that foolishly forgot to ascertain the moral aptitude of Greg before moving in. It is their own fault that they shall all starve! Greg is not the one starving them, the only thing starving them is their own foolishness!!\\n\\n\\nAccording to Libertarians and followers of Negative Rights and the non-aggression principle, Greg is well within his Rights.

But when it comes to human beings, there seems to be some type of taboo in discussing gender differences. I believe the talk of \\'sexism\\' and things like the modern feminist movement, can deter people away from accepting how fundamentally different men and women truly are. \\n\\nWe learn from science that [men have a higher testosterone level](http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/estrogen-and-testosterone-hormones-dictionary.htm) and how this can change the way we interact with others. Science also shows us how  [different hemoglobin levels](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/we-thought-female-athletes-were-catching-up-to-men-but-theyre-not/260927/) explains the strength difference we see between genders.  We also know that [men and women\\'s brains are wired completely differently](http://www.fitbrains.com/blog/women-men-brains/) which explains that \"men’s brains tend to perform tasks predominantly on the left-side, which is the logical/rational side of the brain. while women can transfer data between the right and left hemispheres faster than men\", allowing for better multitasking.  In I.Q. tests with men and women of similar intelligence levels, the men tend to score higher on logical and deductive problems, though the women will generally do better in verbal skills. As professor Steven Goldberg wrote: “the central fact is that men and women are different from each other from the gene to the thought to the act. These differences flow from the biological natures of man and woman.”\\n\\nI understand that some differences among genders is influenced by our environment and society (nurture) and i agree with this, but it is quite obvious to me that we have a great deal of differences from birth (nature). [This article](http://www.livescience.com/22677-girls-dolls-boys-toy-trucks.html) explains how gender toy preference has more to do with biology rather than with society encouraging us. And [this doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiJVJ5QRRUE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=22m18s) explains how we can examine gender differences immediately from birth.  Despite all the effort for gender equality in the Western world today, we can still see both men and women moving and acting upon their own strengths.   When it comes to the professional world, we see men dominating in becoming engineers, accountants, finance workers, mechanics, programmers, construction workers, athletes, etc. Women are dominating in different fields such as nurses, secretaries, administrative assistants, psychiatric and home health aides, maids, child-care workers, receptionists, etc.  \\n\\nToday, as a result of some gender-quality thought groups, there are several kinds of scholarships for women only,  to get them into areas of technology, engineering, etc, where they are not experiencing success as well as men. There are also specialized programs for girls only to help them improve in math &amp; science to compete with the boys. And likewise, there are specialized programs for boys only to help them in reading &amp; writing, to stay at par with girls.  I\\'m not saying these are programs are bad and they should be stopped, but these types of programs can help people ignore the inherent differences between males and females and in a way, they can be thought of as \"fighting biology\".  \\n\\nI would be hesitant to call historical civilizations in past, which displayed a greater separation between the roles of genders as being \\'sexist\\'. In fact, it may be that some of those societies were more in tune with nature, in that each gender was working with their own  strengths as a group. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Here are my two exceptions where I feel it is the fault of the door-opener:\\n\\n1. When the driver or passengers leave the vehicle when it is not in a proper parking spot. This is an illegal time to open the door anyway. I\\'ve seen videos taken in New York of Taxi passengers being like \"this is the best spot to get out, even though my Taxi is still in the middle of the road\", and then BAM. Door prize. This is the passenger\\'s fault.\\n\\n2. When the driver opens the door into a **marked** bike lane (without ensuring it is safe to do so). Note: if the bike lane is positioned correctly, it should never be within the door range of a parked car anyway, so this situation *should* never exist, but in reality it sometimes does exist. In the situations where it does exist, I think that since the driver had to safely cross a **marked** bike lane to park their car, it should be incredibly obvious that they need to be careful when opening their door on the way out. That\\'s why in this situation I think it\\'s the fault of the door-opener.\\n\\nNow on to my arguement. First off, I do cycle on the road in a decent size city from time to time (I used to do it full time), so I am sympathetic to the plights of cyclists. I\\'m not just an ignorant driver yelling from my spot of comfort.\\n\\n(When I do ride, I feel like I ride in a very safe, patient, predictable fashion. For example, I don\\'t pass by cars stopped at intersections because I don\\'t feel that it is reasonable for them to be expected to see me. I\\'ll sit directly behind them in line with their license plate, and I\\'ll let them do what they are doing without me making an erratic, sudden, unexpected pass. If I can\\'t get directly behind them, I\\'ll still let them turn right or left or whatever without darting in front of them or near them. Cars have many blind spots and motorists can\\'t be reasonably expected to check all of them all the time as well as monitor what\\'s in front of them *while* making a turn. Not even the best, most-attentive driver in the world could do so. Therefore, I ride the way I do not only to keep myself safe, but to make life easier and less stressful on motorists. We\\'re all in this together.)\\n\\nDoor-prizing is probably the best example of cyclists having an attitude like \"People have to watch out for me in *blank* situation! I\\'m not at all going to help them not make a mistake in *blank* situation just because I\\'m not legally required to do so even though I could make the same mistake if I was them.\". I understand how in the law it is written that a motorist must always open their door only when it is safe to do so. However, I do not agree with this law as I do not feel that is it reasonable to blame a driver for opening his or her door into the path of a cyclist. Here\\'s why:\\n\\n1. Even the best, most attentive driver can miss a cyclist that is riding close enough to be door-prized. You can shoulder check, mirror check, or whatever. If a cyclist is within only a few feet of that side of your car and coming fast, then they can be difficult to see until it\\'s too late. This is especially true if they are riding parallel with your driver side tires when you are making your checks and then they suddenly turn out to go around you when you go to open the door.\\n\\n2. Pedestrians are expected to cross at crosswalks. Why?  Because a driver can\\'t be expected to monitor for pedestrians that are crossing at every part of the road from every direction, so we put the crosswalks at certain parts of the roads so that the drivers know where to expect pedestrians. Similarly, it\\'s just as reasonable to say, \"cyclists, it is illegal for you to ride in the range of the doors because it\\'s not reasonable for drivers to expect you to be on simply any part of the road you want. You have to be where they expect traffic. They don\\'t expect traffic right next to them when they are parked.\"\\n\\n3. The cyclist, for their own safety, should not be riding in range of the doors. They are doing something incredibly dangerous by riding in the door range of parked cars. If someone is doing something incredibly dangerous, and someone hurts them as a result, then often the person who hurts them should not be held at fault. I feel this is one of those situations.\\n\\n4. Door-prizing a cyclist is a mistake anyone can easily make, and it\\'s **much** easier to teach the cyclist not to ride in the door-prize lane than it is to teach the driver to ensure that every single time they open their door they need to spend the 2 to 3 seconds to do their best to make sure no cyclist is about to dangerously pass them (even if the driver is preoccupied, in a rush, distracted by a child wanting to get out of the car, etc.). Keep in mind you\\'re not just teaching drivers, you\\'d have to teach children too because anyone can be opening one of the doors on that side of the car. Also, I think you\\'d be dishonest with me if you say that every single time you open your car door you are 100% aware of what\\'s next to you. You\\'re lucky that there was never an irresponsible cyclist those times that you did.\\n\\n\\nFinally a cyclist might argue \"sometimes I need to cycle in the \\'door-prize lane\\' because there\\'s not enough room for cars to pass me if I ride further to the left\". In that situation you should simply \"take the lane\", which means that you ride in the centre of the lane so cars cannot pass you. This is 100% legal; you are still riding as far to the right as is safe to do so. If there are cars parked along the side of the road, then the traffic on that road is likely slow enough that you will have little trouble \"taking the lane\". If cars need to pass and you\\'d prefer to not have them sit behind you, you can move over into the \"door-prize lane\" and **stop** and wait until it\\'s reasonable to move into the regular traffic lane again.\\n\\n**EDIT:** Thanks for your opinions everyone. I gotta go to sleep. Some of you made some good points and caused me to rethink my opinion, see new flaws in my opinion, and see how that there are situations where my opinion is bullshit  (NYC, Large British Cities), but I still think my opinion is the more perfect of the two imperfect solutions (i.e. always blame the door-opener or blame the door opener in certain situations only). Also, I\\'m not so douchy and opinionated in normal life, just for you guys :P\\n\\n**EDIT 2:** I\\'m not conceding my opinion! However, a PSA: please be careful when opening your door. You are also legally responsible if you open your door in a parking stall when if someone pulls in next to you. I think The Netherlands trains drivers to open their door with their right hand so that they are forced to turn around when they open it. Might be a worthwhile habit pick up!\\n\\n**EDIT 3:** Because I like hearing my own voice. Cyclists: You can take the lane. I\\'m surprised by the number of people who don\\'t know this.  Just because motorists have to slow down for you that doesn\\'t mean you are doing something illegal. Take the lane if to do otherwise is to ride in an unsafe position on the road. Here\\'s an excellent reference: [LINK](http://www.bikexprt.com/streetsmarts/usa/). Pay particular attention to [LINK](http://www.bikexprt.com/streetsmarts/usa/chapter2a.htm). Don\\'t hesitate to inconvenience drivers *if* *to* *do* *otherwise* *is* *to* *compromise* *your* *safety*. I\\'m not saying go out of your way to be an asshole, just know that your safety is more valuable than someone else saving a few seconds. Regardless, motorists should be patient. They have a nice comfy seat and nice tunes in a nice warm, dry car. They can wait a second or 30 if it means you are safe. If they honk, ignore it. If they get out of their car, pedal away. If they pull out a gun, holy shit. (I\\'m speaking as someone who is both a cyclist and a motorist. I\\'m not just a douchy cyclist who feels they are entitled to the road.)\\n\\n**EDIT 4:** I made some points in the comments that I think are very effective in explaining why I think the way I do. I\\'m going to put them here:\\n\\n* The hazard of riding near parked cars is incredibly obvious to the cyclist but the hazard of opening the car door is not so obvious to the door-opener because of human nature and what we are taught.\\n\\n* The cyclist has more control over where he/she rides than we have control over our occasional forgetfulness (or ignorance), especially while doing something as innocent to our brain as opening a door, no matter how hard we try or how responsible and cautious of a person we are.\\n\\n* The cyclist is **knowingly and deliberately** doing something that is well-understood to be quite dangerous when there are alternatives (even if you are forced into the \"door-lane\", you can always ride slowly there or even come to a stop if that\\'s what it takes to ride safely), while the door-opener is **unknowingly and accidentally** doing something dangerously that 99.99% of the time is safe and harmless.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Many have proposed that this is a plus side of nuclear weapons, that fear of destruction have averted the mas casualties from the previous wars.\\n\\n However my opinion is that on the long run, that will hurt the human race immensely, and if we could change history I would prefer nuclear weapons never existed . My main points are:\\n\\n- **\"Proxy Wars are more destructive than we think\"**: \\n\\nThe Cold War have shown that superpowers will still fight for dominance, but in a more covert way.Instead of massive head-on wars like WW1 and WW2 we had coups and proxy wars, where the super powers would fight (or covertly support) under the pretext of helping, one side of the other, usually leading in civil wars. While individually the number of casualties aren\\'t compared with total war, those clashes in Asia,Africa and Europe took a lot more time (sometimes decades) to subside, created permanent bad blood in some countries that could spur new clashes all the time (spilling more blood) and atrocities where commonplace due to the inherent nature of civil war.\\n\\n- **\"Modern warfare is less destructive than World War standards\":**\\n\\n Following the previous statement, I would like to point out that destruction of property and loss of life is greater in these proxy wars than if we had two modern superpowers fighting each other openly. As Napoleonic tactics where obsolete by WW1, so the 20th century tactics of mass Conscription, Carpet bombing and total war are obsolete now. Most modern armies are based on surgical strikes on tactical and strategic targets crippling the enemy the opening days of a war, by air force or special trained teams and the rest of the army is usually used for establishing control of the conquered area. I believe that civilian centers would be spared compared to WW2, so a conventional WW3 would be less destructive than the ongoing proxy wars. For example, from a cynical view, if Russia could pull all its might against Ukraine instead of using \"concerned citizens\", the war would be over by now, with much less loss of life and property.\\n\\n- **\"A Nuclear War will be always possible.\":**\\n\\n Finally my major concern is that a Global Nuclear War is never out of the question, and the results of one would make a conventional one look like a tea party.\\n\\n We cant guarantee that  the political situation for the following years or decades will be the same as the previous. The stalemate of the official borders right now while people and cultures are ever changing and moving can create suppressed situations that might erupt. A mad man might be elected President or the public may feel invincible by patriotic fervor causing a launch. Numerous times [we have avoided a launch in the nick of time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III#Historical_close_calls). The destruction of a Nuclear War would be  on an unprecedented scale, and this time no country will be unaffected to rebuild. After each clash in the previous centuries, some power or other would rise to fill the power void. However, in this case, if the bombs start flying there aren\\'t going to be an unaffected USA to rebuild Europe, a safe South america and Switzerland  or a Soviet Union to push the technology race onwards. We might even have an extinction event. \\n\\n\\nIn conclusion , while  in a personal level I wouldn\\'t like my country or any other whatsoever to experience war again, in a macro level if I could do the impossible to dismantle all the Nuclear weapons I would do it even if that spurred a World War. \\n\\n**Between a conventional  World War 3 and Nuclear Detente I would prefer the War, for the future of the Human race as a whole.

IMHO, there's no difference - either there are some instances when it's ok to kill even if your life isn't in danger (and if this is your stance, then how could it possibly not be ok to kill someone who desperately wants to die because they're in agonizing pain and is going to die anyway?), or it's not ok to kill if your life isn't in danger (in which case, war is off the table for you). \"},\n {'title': 'CMV: snitching is not morally wrong',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2kpfso',\n  'selftext': \"There seems to be a whole culture on hating on snitches or people who rat out on what other people are doing.

My nation (the United States) has a long history of controversy in regards to marriage. Up until [1967](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia), inter-racial marriage was illegal in many states. Today, I suspect, most of the public supports the legality of inter-racial marriage. Since [1862](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrill_Anti-Bigamy_Act) Plural marriages (known mostly for the practice's association with the Mormon church) has been illegal. Then, of course, in recent years there's been the controversy over gay marriage - George W. Bush putting [opposition into law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act) and over course his successor, Barack Obama, pushing in the opposite direction. \\n\\nPersonally, I just don't see why these issues are any business of the government. During the debate over gay marriage, the 'slippery slope' argument was often cited - that if you legalize gay marriage, next thing you know women will be wanting to marry a zebra or something. Personally, I say if the Zebra can sign the documents and take the vows, who am I to stand in the way of love? Frankly, I don't see it as my business.\\n\\nThe issue of plural marriage is more controversial; it's been associated with abuse, forced marriage, sexual assault of minors. But to my mind, it would be more sensible to pass laws against abuse, forced marriage, and sexual assault than to ban plural marriage - which does not inherently include any of this. \\n\\nMy opinion is this: I see no advantage and significant disadvantage to Government regulation of marriage. The marriage contract, at it's heart, is just a civil contract that comes with tax incentives and a few other incentives, such as inheritance rights and the ability to visit loved ones in the hospital. This contract should be governed by the people who want to enter into it, and subject to no more or less restriction and oversight than other contracts. \\n \\nI invite you to change my view\\n\\n*Full disclosure: I am currently in a polyamorous relationship with a partner I would very much like to marry some day, but who also has another partner whom she would also like to marry someday.

Nobody set no one back. You can not prove what and who set anyone back and you can\\'t have serious discussions where the main premise of the discussion is \"what if\" and \"what would happen\". Those kinds of conversations are for pubs only, when you get drunk. That\\'s when you allowed to pull the \"what if\" card, for example \"what if Ray Allen missed that 3 pointer\". \\n\\nOther than that, you\\'re projecting your agenda in a very obvious way, nobody, no computer and no scientist and no spiritual man can tell you what would happen IF Z happened instead of X. \\n\\nSo, to finish up, I think people who want to perpetuate the gap between spirituality and science are naive, biased, have some kind of agenda, maybe they\\'re getting back at their strict christian parents or who knows.\\n\\nThere\\'s a big difference in \"organized religion\" and \"personal belief\" and that\\'s another topic.

I'm not registered as Democrat because I have concerns about the party and their platform.  Still, in almost every election I have voted for the Democrat, because every Republican candidate I have seen in my adult life has been pants-on-head insane.  I am an informed voter and I cannot bring myself to vote for crazies.  That usually makes my vote default to Democrat in presidential election years.\\n\\nBut I have never voted in a mid-term election.  My vote is a small voice in a sea of people who oppose my views.  This is a 'red' (republican-leaning) state, and my vote here does not count.  (My vote probably doesn't count in presidential elections either -- South Dakota went for Romney by 18% in 2012 -- but if I don't vote for president then I can't complain about him.)\\n\\nThis year I've been tempted to vote because we have one of the closest mid-term elections yet:  Our race for Senator is tight by local standards, with the Democrat challenger polling just 9% behind the scandal-ridden Republican.  Still, that's 9% -- a huge gap in any other state.  The Republican candidate for Representative leads by 21%.  In the governor race, the Republican is polling 28% over the Democrat challenger.  The smaller local races are full of candidates I do not know and are not informed about.  There are two ballot measures that I have an opinion on, but I am certain that whatever my opinion is it will be drowned out by opposing votes, because nearly everyone in this state has opinions opposite to mine.  I am so out of sync with the general populace here that I avoid even voicing my opinions for fear of getting shouted down.\\n\\nDemocrats used to be able to win the rare election in South Dakota by leaning toward the center.  This is not the case anymore.  In the past couple of decades Republican voters have become (let's say) dogmatic, and they demand ever further shifts to the right from their candidates.  Democrats can no longer appeal to the new hard-right populace of this state.  Elections here are strictly partisan, and the side I favor is a distant, feckless underdog.  It isn't worth my time to go to the polls.\\n\\nIn summary:  I could vote, but why, when my preferred candidates are guaranteed to lose?\\n\\nEdit:  Let me refute a few points that have come up repeatedly.\\n\\n**Politicians that win by thin margins legislate more cautiously** -- I don't believe this is true today.  In today's partisan politics, each party governs to favor their side as hard as they can.\\n\\n**A minority vote carries more weight in a congressional district** -- South Dakota has only one representative.  There are no districts to my knowledge (if there are, they have no effect).  I'll admit that a minority vote might be important to local elections, but I know nothing about those candidates.\\n\\n**Votes tell the loser how much money to allocate next time** -- I don't believe Democrats can ever win in today's South Dakota politics.  If my vote encourages them to try, then I'm doing them a favor by not voting so they won't waste their money.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Genocide is bad or undesirable because under legitimate definition, it involves the infliction of objective harms on a group of people.  Its ultimate harms are to those individual people, and that is what condemns the act of genocide, rather than any destruction of some higher-order social consciousness or institution.\\n\\nImplicit in the notion of cultural genocide is the idea that traditions and cultural norms are inherently worthy.  This is false; traditions are only ever as good as the acts they endorse or promote.  Traditions (or the acts that constitute them) may *generally* be good and thus become traditions because *they work*, but it is nearly never the case that something works *because* it is a tradition.\\n\\nCultures are not entities that have or can have rights, nor are cultural differences inherently valuable (or wrong, for that matter).

No, what I\\'m trying to redeem are judgments based on character and weighed against experience.\\n\\nFor example, I am deeply put-off by thug culture and anybody who espouses it. When somebody I just met feels the need to tell me about a violent bout they had with their \"friend\" the other night, or talk about how many times they\\'ve had a gun pulled on them, I instantly judge that they are no enemy to violence and subsequently take on a sort of inherent aversion to their company (i.e. a judgment).

I have a feeling most people would agree with my former one and that would make it harder to argue against my view. Here\\'s an easier one. My sister has a tattoo that reads \"Only God Can Judge Me.\" Likewise I have heard it said widely that \"we shouldn\\'t judge each other.\" I have pointed out certain glaring character flaws in others and been outright dismissed because \"You can\\'t judge me.\" Once I was physically and verbally assaulted by a female for refusing her romantic/sexual advances on the grounds that I didn\\'t like certain things about her character. Everybody who witnessed the incident agreed unanimously that I was the asshole, that I was malicious/malevolent toward her, and that nobody deserves to be insulted in that way (by being judged in a neutral fashion based on their character traits/flaws). I think this is a dangerous mentality to have and a dangerous prescription to adhere to. We need judgment to tell us all kinds of things about another person and to determine how much (or if) we trust them, what kinds of relationships we want to pursue with them, what kinds of behavior we can expect from them, and certainly more details I haven\\'t included here. To forego judgment would be to essentially live socially (and politically!) blind.\\n\\nSo, /r/CMV , try to convince me that there is something inherently wrong with judging other people based on their character.

I chose Harry Potter, because I didn\\'t care anymore, but also because *I actually believed that it was literary* and I supported my claims with passages from the books that showed that literary techniques were used. I also said that novels currently seen as literary were at one point popular novels in there day. The teachers response was \"I does not count because it is popular fiction\" What I took from that was that the definition of a modern literary novel was a novel no one read. \\n\\nSo what I found was that the idea that english class was suppose to teach you critical thinking skills is wrong, and it instead teaches you how to bullshit in order to receive rewards.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

A lot of these companies already have wages that are inconsistent with the federal average; they're often higher. Conservatives often talk about abolishing the minimum wage, which I do not agree with. The invisible hand has to do with a establishing a maximum, not a medium--wages would be worse if it were not for that sole standard\\n\\nBut is it not silly in the modern age to hold both small businesses and billion dollar corporations to the same standard? Couldn't we adapt a law similar to the one in Seattle, only we increase the minimum wage on industries that exceed a certain profit margin. The minimum wage would stay the same for small businesses, or maybe rise with inflation over time. It would not go into effect immediate--companies would have at least 5 years to adjust to this new standard, to curtail the loss of jobs. No small business in the modern age is going to be able to manage a $15+ minimum wage, with multiple works on shift.\\n\\nHell, my store barely makes budget on most days, and we're a rather large company. Both sides seem to have valid concerns. So couldn't we realistically meet somewhere in the middle? Small businesses struggle enough in the modern age. We live in corporate America. And if the minimum wage did rise with inflation, it would be closer to $22 an hour. Obviously, most companies would not be able to afford this without cutting a vast number of workers, so that's not ideal. But a $12 minimum? That would be a drastic improvement for most states--and companies could implement this overtime, and potentially request an extension, so long as they produce evidence that they're attempting to abide by federal law.\\n\\nEnough workers would be uprooted out of poverty that it would be beneficial.

When there's more money in circulation, more goods are purchase. Profit margins may actually increase.\\n\\nI think there's this notion in our country that business and civilians have to work against each other, but it seems the opposite is true--more money, more profit.So would this modest increase actually do anything other than uproot people out of poverty, and maybe allow more students to attend school without fear of college debt?\\n\\nI'm sure my arguments have tons of holes in them that I haven't considered, so explain to me why I'm wrong.\"},\n {'title': 'CMV: Children should be taught that sexual orientation is a continuum',\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2keotr',\n  'selftext': 'I was given the modern, \"politically correct\" version of sex-ed by my parents and teachers: That there are straight people and gay people, and sometimes occasionally bi people too, and that all of these were valid and equal and so on and so forth. I know the people who taught me that meant well and weren\\'t homophobic or anything like that, but it still screwed me up a fair bit later. I (a male) was always fairly feminine as a child, played mainly with girls, liked cute things and stuffed toys, and even at one point wanted to wear nail polish. My parents were totally accepting of this (again, they were well-meaning, tolerant people) but probably suspected I was gay. I knew I wasn\\'t gay though. I liked girls, I wanted to have a wife when I grew up, etcetra. Later on in late elementary and middle school I started acting less feminine, mainly because of the inevitable mockery by my peers, but I still sometimes let my hair grow down below my shoulders and wore brightly-coloured clothes and did other things boys in my class thought were effeminate. I still thought I was 100% straight, and in middle school and high school had various ordinary awkward relationships with girls. About halfway through high school, though, I fell in love with my male best friend, who was openly bisexual and himself fairly feminine. I felt terrible and weird and awkward because I knew I wasn\\'t gay, but here I was having all kinds of sexual fantasies about men. In the end I ended up having a mainly sexual relationship with him, because I was incredibly attracted to him but also didn\\'t believe I could fall in love with a man. He, however, was completely in love with me, and so I ended up being cruel to him and basically saying I only liked him sexually but not romantically, because I still wanted to marry a woman and so on, which in retrospect was incredibly cruel. I also felt extremely guilty because I thought I was just so horny that I was willing to have sex with men I was \"actually\" straight, and that this made me a pervert etc. Eventually I remembered my effeminacy as a child, and decided that even though I was still mainly attracted to women, that didn\\'t preclude me ever having relationships with men. I think I\\'m hardly the only person who feels this way, and I think sex education should reflect it. Kids should be told something like \"most people tend to like people of the other sex, but sometimes people like someone of the same sex, and sometimes they even marry people of the same sex, and that\\'s also completely okay.\" That would encompass straight people, exclusively gay people, and people like me who are mostly one way or the other but make exceptions for certain people.\\n\\n**TL;DR despite what politically correct people want you to think, sexual orientation isn\\'t a black and white biological thing, and telling kids that it is has the potential to mess them up later**\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That said, I think that it\\'s pretty clear that her arguments rely on very skewed examples, and as such, her arguments hold little ground.\\n\\n.1. The crux of her arguments, all of them, rely on the statement that media and pop culture influences how we behave. For her videos, this \\'influence\\' manifests as \\'misogyny\\' and a \\'sexist culture\\'. Yet, when I look to her videos, I don\\'t see any established and respected articles that make claims that back up her argument. In fact, I\\'ve never seen any articles that establish this, and have always found it to be the opposite - the society *inspires* culture, not the other way around.\\n\\n.2. Very obvious cherry picking, and, at the very least, directly misleading descriptions of game mechanics. The most obvious ones to my mind, and for the sake of brevity, are those of Hitman, and Red Dead Redemption. In her discussion of Hitman, she makes the following statement:\\n\\n&gt;\"players are meant to derive a perverse pleasure from desecrating the bodies from unsuspecting female characters, it\\'s a myth concocted mix of sexual arousal, connected to the act of controlling and punishing representations of female sexuality\"\\n\\nThis is *deliberately* dishonest on her part. Her video shows the player character (presumed to be her), moving these female bodies around whilst she makes the above statement - as if the game encourages and supports the act of you killing these women and playing with their corpses. Even if we ignore the fact that, playing as the titular Hitman, you can move *all* corpses around for the sake of hiding them from view - the game *actively* incentivizes *not* killing innocent civilians via a penalization for every \"mistake\" you make in your mission. Sarkeesian states that these women were:\\n\\n&gt;placed in the environment for that singular purpose\\n\\nWhilst ignoring the contextual plot elements they give if you choose to listen to their dialogue, whilst ignoring their (mechanical) purpose in game as a segment to sneak past, to ignore the justification they give for the actual \"assassination\" due to the targets mistreatment of them. Sarkeesian states that gamers are:\\n\\n&gt;invite to explore\\n\\nThe ways in which they could \\'derive perverse pleasure\\' by \\'desecrating\\' the womens bodies. This is like saying that game developers invite you to explore the thrill of falling to your death in any game where you can fall from large heights - just because you *can* do it in a game, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s something that the developers, makers, and larger culture at hand, support.\\n\\nFor Red Dead, the only segment\\'s she chooses to represent this game is one in which a \\'whore\\' is being attacked by a drunkard - in which Sarkeesians character stands and watchs the women die, representing this as the \\'de facto\\' way that scenario plays out. Again, like Hitman, she ignores the wider mechanics, the fact that the player is *encouraged* to stop the above happening via a reward system and so on.\\n\\nBy cherrypicking examples like this, Sarkeesian represents these games as incredibly misogynistic and violently anti-woman. And this is something I find in her videos *all the time*.\\n\\n.3. Relying on faulty, unsubstantiated, subjective arguments. For example - she denoucnes Princess Peach as a \\'damsel in distress\\' and a weak character, relying on the men around her to save her. Yet, ironically enough given the purpose of her videos is to examine cultural and gender problems, the way she measures Princess Peaches worth as a character is by comparing her to the men around her, and as such, to a limited list of \\'positive\\' character traits. \\n\\nPrincess Peach is a weak character because she isn\\'t physically \\'strong\\' and \\'capable\\' like Mario - but this is a comparison that draws on very \\'masculine\\' character traits. Why doesn\\'t she praise Peach for being incredibly mentally strong for being able to so easily and capably withstand the problems life throws at her? Why doesn\\'t she recognize the very clear power Peach holds as a \\'Princess\\' in her kingdom - a kingdom, that by all accounts, love and admire her as a princess despite her penchance for being kidnapped? How does Peach not being a playable character make her a worse character? Why aren\\'t the games in which Peach *is* playable recognized? Are only male characteristics worthy of applaud?\\n\\nThe only way to be a \\'good\\' female character, it appears, is to be a female with all the stereotypical characteristics of a male. I think this is a *very* flawed and damaging premise.\\n\\nAgain, these sort of comments are things I find commonplace in her videos, and I\\'m using the example of Peach for the sake of brevety.\\n\\n.4. Ignoring other arguments. Sarkeesian uses \\'tropes\\' to examine the various ways in which female characters are presented in videogames, in a very general way. These tropes, she argues, highlight a \\'trend\\' in the way women are treated in stereotypical and sexist ways. But to do this ignores the very obvious, very well established, *male* tropes that make up in videogames. I have no problem with complaining or criticizing these tropes as overwrought, but I do take the statements that these tropes are \\'harmful\\' with a lot of doubt.\\n\\nThe idea that a \\'trope\\' is a bad thing is one I find falacious - many tropes are simply easily identifiable, relatable, recognizable mechanics of story/design/function that help set a groundwork for whatever is aiming to be achieved.\\n\\n.5. Refusal to open dialogue. I understand Sarkeesian has suffered harrassment, but I do not believe that is justification for the complete lack of dialogue towards her critics. \\n\\nSo, CMV!\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Our generation should work to remove the concept entirely from the American psyche. Here are the reasons why it\\'s BS:\\n\\n1. Physical virginity: In women, the concept of the hymen being the physical manifestation of virginity is ridiculous and has lead to the actual deaths of thousands of women worldwide. The hymen does not \"break\" the first time you have sex; when you are born there\\'s a small hole in it,  which begins to tear at a fairly young age due to any number of physical activities, and can tear a lot more during sex, but often the hymen has torn completely by that point. Some women are born without hymens altogether.\\n\\n2. Psychological: I believe that the concept of being \"different\" after you have sex for the first time is largely ingrained into young women\\'s (and to a lesser extent, young men\\'s) minds through media and the beliefs of other people. I do not believe that after having sex for the first time you are a fundamentally different/more mature person. \\n\\n3. Social: I believe the concept of virginity puts a lot of pressure on young people to find \"the right person\" to have sex with for the first time, and that there is a lot of virgin-shaming/slut-shaming that goes on if other people think you \"lost it\" too early, too late, or in the wrong way. This not only leads to a lot of negative feelings towards the experience in general, but a lot of pressure and expectation surrounding sex. In addition, there is a lot of pressure to make the first time \"special\", leading to even more pressure.\\n\\n4. The virginity threshold: Most people view PIV sex as \"real sex\", and in an atmosphere with a lot of horny teenagers, young people who feel they are not ready to \"lose their virginities\" yet will use different methods to fulfill their sexual needs. There is kind of an idea that everything leading up to sex is no big deal, while sex is a huge deal. For example, oral sex with someone might be seen as nothing at all because technically a penis doesn\\'t go into a vagina, whereas it should hold more weight than that. \\n\\n5. Heteronormativity: The concept as PIV sex being the only \"real\" sex for heterosexual people is harmful to heterosexual people, but it is also harmful to the LGBTQ+ community because it makes other kinds of sex seem less intimate and real. It also causes confusion for young LGBTQ+ people when it comes to what their sexual acts \"mean\" in terms of being in a relationship. \\n\\nThose are my big five thoughts on virginity and why it is not only a completely made-up concept but an exclusively harmful one--so change my view and tell me why virginity is a valuable concept for our society. \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Imagination and creativity are what makes these games special. Not memorization and repetition of sequences, patterns, and key bindings.\\n\\nI don\\'t think that is fun nor do I think it is good for games overall.

I vehemently disagree. 100 years of social pressure did nothing to force the South to desegregate. 100 years of social pressure has done nothing to alleviate Japanese xenophobia. Like crime, murder, and theft, racism is one of those qualities that can never be completely eliminated, only suppressed via government force. Moreover, a Libertarian mindset is the *worst possible* to try to socially pressure people to conform to ethical standards. The vast majority of Libertarians are against any sort of social conformity (excluding social expectations on the concept of their property). \\n\\n\\nWhat will actually happen if racism (in terms of discrimination on housing, employment, and public services) is legalized, is that the free market will react to the demand of racist services. Markets will react by opening up segregated shops and restaurants. Homeowner associations will open up segregated housing units and neighborhoods. As society becomes more segregated, racism will become normalized once again and we will be right back in the social situation of 1950. People will grow up with a life where the only people they know are the same race because they grew up in a segregated neighborhood, and attended a segregated private school, and got a job at a segregated business. They will label minorities as the \"Other\", because minorities will indeed become the \"Other\" when you have absolutely no experience with them.\\n\\nThe country will become divided up into those that tolerate other races and those that don\\'t. Nonconformists will be forced to move when businesses, social clubs, and homeowner\\'s associations impose trade sanctions on either racists or non-racists. Because the majority race has the most economic power, these trade sanctions will one-sided and thus be most damaging to minorities.\\n\\n\"Oh but this will never happen!\" Yes it will. The more important question is on *what kind of scale*? Will this discrimination only happen in isolated areas? Will it be so small to be negligible? Or will it become widespread and eventually become the norm, like it has in so many other countries? \\n\\nI tire of discussions of natural rights and how Libertarians treat everyone with equality, because everyone is allowed to discriminate equally! Please don\\'t bring those up, I find them completely unconvincing. The only things that will convince me are practical, utilitarian, or empirical arguments.

Updated my LinkedIn profile and connected with professionals in my field of interest.\\n\\nAs a result, I\\'ve attained three separate internships for this semester, next semester, and the semester after I graduate, all while nannying to support myself financially. Additionally, I have a few exciting interviews lined up for “real” full time positions. Consequently, I have a job offer from the company I\\'m interning at, but want to keep my options open.\\n\\nI\\'ve worked hard throughout college, but don\\'t consider myself to be particularly exceptional. I\\'m only getting positive results because I’m pushing hard every single day to get what I want. Therefore, when I hear friends from my university who are just as qualified as me complain about their lack of prospects, I can\\'t help but feel like they brought it upon themselves. For example:\\n\\n1. One friend complains about having to move back in with her parents after graduation, but hasn’t sent out ANY resumes for ANY jobs. She could be saving money for the next eight months for an apartment, but instead has given up before the fight has even begun. (Note: her parents are fully supporting her financially, so she easily could be working and saving money.)\\n\\n2. Another friend who just graduated is depressed about having to move in with his grandparents and not finding work. He said he sent \"fifteen\" resumes and “should\\'ve found something by now.” Um... fifteen resumes? Fifteen isn\\'t nearly enough. He\\'s perfectly qualified, but he just isn\\'t trying. \\n\\nMy friends are smart, talented, and from a great university. However, I can\\'t help but feel many college students expect a job to just drop into their laps. I have no sympathy for students who aren\\'t finding jobs. My solution? WORK HARDER, and if that isn\\'t working for you, then WORK SMARTER. All of my friends who have done this have obtained positions at great companies.\\n\\nThat being said, I realize that finding work can be really difficult and I don\\'t like being judgmental.

I think of them as stamp or coin collectors - think what happens when you try and take an album from an avid collector (\"who needs so many stamps, most of which are cancelled anyway!\").\\n\\nIt should be no surprise that many pieces of regulation provoke the same response. And they should - think about recent pieces of legislation that limited the number of rounds in magazine to 7. It just so happens that many highly collectable military guns from WWI and WWII are over this limit - and now you said that someone who have just paid $5000 for a fully matching (including the magazine!) WWII Luger needs to get rid of this pesky mag - which will lower the value of the gun by 2/3.\\n\\nNow, stamps or coins can\\'t kill people, right?\\n\\nThis is true, of course, BUT forcing restrictions on guns, especially the ones that make very little impact on the actual number of deaths (majority of gun legislation has been recently focused on mass murder, which kills fewer people per year than lightning) pushes a very large number of people into Republican camp. This is especially true for white middle class males with less than high school education, who benefit the least from Republican policies, yet are drawn to them because of red meat issues such as gun control.\\n\\nMy assertion is that letting Republicans own gun issue kills vastly more people than gun legislation prevents. If we took gun people from the Republican camp, they would have no change for legislative victories in their current ultra-rightwing form. Many wars would not have happened, saving literally hundreds of thousands of people (it will take a few hundred years for our current gun legislation to just make up for Iraq body count, for instance). We would have had better health care, sooner, also saving tens of thousands per year.\\n\\nSo IMHO, based strictly on the body count, our current attempt of gun legislation is a VERY BAD THING.

[Paul Erdős](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) made a lot of contributions to mathematics while using amphetamine and methylphenidate (both of which are far more powerful and dangerous than what you\\'d see people mentioning in /r/nootropics).\\n\\n- Some people think the fact people are willing to use these might be indicative of, like, society\\'s misplaced priorities or something. *We should work to live, not live to work*, they might think. *We shouldn\\'t expose ourselves to possible harm in the pursuit of cognitive enhancement*.

Also, for the purposes of the CMV cannabis consumption refers to the inhalation of smoke from burning cannabis buds, as opposed to more exotic methods of consumption.)*\\n\\nAs an adult of legal age in Washington state, I am allowed to purchase cannabis from a government-licensed store and consume it in my own house. For the purpose of this CMV, let\\'s assume others have similar rights such that legality is not a concern.\\n\\nThe known effect (and implicit goal) of drinking alcohol or smoking cannabis is to temporarily alter the brain\\'s chemistry to produce enjoyable sensations. By almost every metric I can think of, cannabis is a superior substance to use to achieve this goal.\\n\\n* **Safety:** Alcohol poisoning, alcohol related organ failures, and intoxicated accidents kill hundreds of thousands of people a year. Very drunk people are known to become violent, emotional, and dangerous to themselves and others. Cannabis\\'s effects are caused by THC, which is very nontoxic to ingest. The amount of THC required to overdose and die from cannabis use is literally impossible to consume quickly enough to maintain a fatal saturation. Studies have shown that [cannabis use does not lead to more driving accidents](http://norml.org/library/item/marijuana-and-driving-a-review-of-the-scientific-evidence) and the most common effect of driving high in simulator tests is reduced speed. (Still, don\\'t drive impaired, regardless of what you\\'re using). I can only speak from anecdotal evidence, but I have never seen cannabis cause an aggressive or violent reaction in the user.\\n\\n* **Controlled intoxication:** Consuming alcohol with a specific level of intoxication in mind (other than blackout drunk) is a challenging task. Variations in drink strength and methods of consumption can make it harder to judge one\\'s level of intoxication, and the timing and order of consumption plays a significant role in how the alcohol affects the body and how enjoyable the experience is. The duration of alcohol intoxication is usually many hours, which generally means that by consuming alcohol the drinker has implicitly accepted that they will not be safely able to do certain tasks or make certain decisions for the remainder of the day/night. Cannabis, especially state regulated cannabis, comes with detailed information regarding THC content and the heredity of the specific plant being consumed. This allows the user to tailor their cannabis experience to achieve or avoid specific effects, and with some planning (although no more than counting your drinks) accurately control the length and intensity of their cannabis intoxication. The duration of intoxication from smoking cannabis is typically shorter than that of consuming alcohol, and leaves the user capable of functioning normally with few ill effect after use.\\n\\n* **Effects:** Alcohol generally lowers the inhibitions, impairs the judgement, and increases the volume of the person consuming it. Heavy consumption can lead to loss of motor control, disorientation, blackouts, and alcohol poisoning. The effects of cannabis depend largely on the genetics of the plant in question, and can be carefully tailored by growers to induce a specific intoxicating effect. Plants from the species *Cannabis Indica* tend to cause feelings of calm, drowsiness, and relaxation. Plants from the species *Cannabis Sativa* tend to cause uplifting, energetic, or cerebral effects. Excessive consumption of cannabis may lead to dizziness, paranoia, or \\'couch-lock\\', but there are no chemically harmful effects (such as alcohol poisoning).\\n\\n* **Aftermath:** Hangovers suck. Waking up and feeling like you just want to trow up and die is no fun at all. Cannabis has negligible aftereffects, and (anecdotally again) cannabis use after heavy alcohol consumption significantly reduces the pain of the next morning\\'s hangover. Alcohol and alcohol byproducts remain in the body for 1-2 days at most after intoxicating effects have ceased. Cannabis byproducts remain in the bloodstream and urine for 2-6 weeks depending on frequency of use and body type, and can be detected in hair samples far beyond that.\\n\\n* **Price:** In Washington, lower-end state-regulated liquor sells for around $35 per 1.75 liters. This converts to about $1 per shot, which is on par with roughly $1 a beer when buying from a grocery store. Assuming consumption of 6 drinks in a night, the at-home cost is $6. At a bar, event, or stadium, drink prices are significantly more expensive, and 6 drinks (including tips) can quickly surpass $50. At current prices (which are expected to fall as supply and demand balance out) you can purchase 2 grams of high-potency cannabis from a regulated store for $60. Calculating an equivalent scale of grams of cannabis per drink is a difficult task, but by my math (2g can make 4 0.5g bowls which can each get 3 people to the equivalent intoxication of 5 drinks) it still comes out to roughly $1 per drink equivalent. Bulk cannabis from a medical co-op is much less expensive ($250 per oz = 28g), and lowers the price to $0.30 per drink equivalent.\\n\\n* **Social acceptance:** Alcohol wins this one hands down. In adulthood, someone who doesn\\'t consume alcohol occasionally is considered the exception rather than the norm. Cannabis is still widely seen in the connotations of \"dope for hippies and stoners\", and cannabis use is not considered a suitable topic for discussion the way alcohol use is. Much of modern nightlife is centered around going out and consuming alcohol socially, and there is no equivalent cannabis culture yet. For younger audiences there are a wide range of drinking games played socially with alcohol, but few (if any) social games revolving around cannabis consumption.\\n\\nIn short, I believe that cannabis is objectively superior to alcohol in terms of achieving a state of recreational intoxication. By the metrics I have stated, I feel that cannabis is the superior substance in all cases except social acceptance, and that is a nebulous metric that is subject to change and unrelated to the effects that either substance has on the user. \\n\\nThe best way to CMV would be to point out one or more metrics I have not considered where alcohol is preferable to cannabis, or show that my logic in assessing the metrics I have used is incorrect. The goal of this CMV is not to start an argument between \\'stoners\\' and \\'teetotalers\\', but rather to objectively compare two intoxicating substances on their merits and drawbacks.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** All things considered, I\\'d rather get intoxicated on cannabis than on alcohol.\\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Comparisons between christianity are faulty. Jesus Christ espoused ideals of love, peace, forgiveness and so on. Muhammed may have espoused or characterized some of these ideals - but he was also a war lord, a warrior, a man who had multiple wives (including the child bride Aisha), and a man who beheaded jews. Whilst I'll never dismiss the fact both books contain violent verses, the prophets of both religions are vastly different. \\n\\nMuhammed committed 65 campaigns of war, all successful. This imbues islam with a militaristic history of empire, and of conquering other nations. Islam cannot be a religion of peace for the same reason that religion cannot entirely be a religion of war - it contains periods of both. But no monotheistic religion can be described as peaceful, as history demonstrates.\\n\\n-2. The current situations in many majority muslim countries - such as issues of apostacy, punishment for 'crimes'(such as being raped and suffering stoning), the treatment of homosexuals and women, the prevelance of extremism and so forth. Whilst I don't ignore the geo/socio/econmical politics that lend to these issues, I believe that Islam is a fundamental aspect of the conversation. Furthermore, I won't pretend that countries like Turkey and Indonesia don't exist, but I also won't pretend that these countries don't also have their fair share of problems, of which Islam is central to many.\\n\\n-3. According to Brigitt Gabriel, the numbers of Islamic extremists lands anywhere between 10-30% of all total muslims. At the most conservative numbers, that is still millions of people. A common phrase I hear is that 'the majority of muslims are peaceful'. My response to that is that the majority of Germans were peaceful pre-WW2, the majority of the Japanese were peaceful pre-WW2, the majority of Chinese were peaceful pre-Mao, but history has taught us that the peaceful majority have been irrelevant. Minorities have pushed agendas that have resulted in millions of people dead. \\n\\nIt took 9 extremists to kill thousands on 9/11. It took less in Spain and Britain in the years after. There are currently millions of extremists who wish to do western society harm. That needs to be discussed openly and frankly.\\n\\n-4. It is not racist to criticize Islam. Islam is a religion, not a race. Furthermore, it is also not islamophobic to criticize these elements of islam - fear of radicalization isn't illogical, especially in the current climate. If you support the notion that it *is* islamophobic, then you must also agree that any such criticism of christianity is 'christophobic, or of hinduism as 'hinduphobic', of any other ideology with the prefix of 'phobic'.\\n \\n-5. The vast, vast majority of terrorist attacks over the past decade or so have been performed by islamic extremists. I believe that islamic belief is one of the overwhelming reasons in terms of responsibility for these attacks. I find the notion that the actions of some muslims are not in some way influenced by islam as ridiculous. Anecdotally, I have recieved racism at the hands of muslim groups, via both physical and verbal violence. I've also read and witnessed many accounts of others who've suffered the same. There is a difficult conversation to be had about the assimilation of some muslims into western society, especially in Britain. There have been some disturbing studies regarding some of the beliefs of muslims in the uk regarding views on things such as homosexuality, which I'll try to dig up.\\n\\n-6. The way in which those who are critical of islam are treated. It is disgustingly unjust that those who criticize islam in the west are subjected to fatwa's and deathtreats by influential muslim imams in the middle east. The fact that citizens of europe are forced to go into hiding in their native countries due to their criticism is absolutely intolerable - and the fact that people have died over something as inane as cartoons in the case of Van Gogh, fills me with unrelenting disgust. Furthermore, the way muslims violently protest these things in their own countries is completely unacceptable.\\n\\nAs a conclusion of sorts, I think islam *is* different to many other religions, and I think there are some serious issues that need to be discussed and reconciled regarding it, which I hope I've illustrated above. I don't think these issues are being discussed, which I also hope I've due highlighted above.\\n\\nSo, CMV!\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You've just arrived at the pearly gates of Biblical heaven. Everything is awesome. FUCKING awesome. As doctrinally promised, you retain more or less the physical form that you had on Earth, but obviously in its absolute peak, devoid of previous imperfections. Your mind, too, is better than it was before - much better. You can do whatever you want, in total bliss and comfort, surrounded by the creme de la creme, the best people who ever lived - not to mention your main man JC and The Big Man Upstairs. You're stoked. Eternity is going to be SWEET. \\n\\nFast-forward a thousand Earth years. You've been in Heaven a pretty long time now, but you're still having an awesome time. You've met a lot of people, but there's plenty more to meet. After all, on Earth there were around 3 billion Christians. Not all of them would have been good Christians, but even if only 1% of them did a good enough job to get into Heaven, that's still 30 million people, and surely the proportion of good Christians is more than 1%! Furthermore, since you all would have followed the Bible pretty closely, you're all going to have quite a lot in common, so you just know you're going to get on well with them. It's not just the people, of course. There's so much to enjoy in Heaven too! Anything you can imagine can be achieved, and as you're at your complete best ALL THE TIME, your imagination is working on overdrive! This is SWEET!\\n\\nNow fast-forward ten billion Earth years. Even operating at your absolute peak imagination, you ran out of original ideas for shit to do about (let's be generous here) 500,000 years after you arrived at the gates. That was 9 and a half billion years ago. You're really bored of your own mind, now. (Remember, the Bible promised you that YOU - that is, a semblance of the limited being that lived on earth and earned its way to heaven - would get to Heaven, so even in your Heavenly form, you must also be in some way limited). You get to share in the ideas of lots of other people too, though. Let's be SUPER generous here, and pretend that (even though you're all Christians, and therefore - at least to some degree - think in similar ways) each individual person has another 500,000 years worth of original material in their minds. After TEN BILLION YEARS, the thought of doing new stuff all the time isn't quite as fun as it used to be. You never get physically tired, or mentally 'drained' in the way a limited human being would on Earth. Even so, you are experiencing things similarly to how your Earthly self would have - that is, through your five senses and through your emotions (that's how the promise of Heaven is explained in the Bible, remember - as an extension of Earthly pleasures). The possible positive combinations that you can experience in these ways are starting to be exhausted. It's not quite so sweet anymore.\\n\\nNow fast forward a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years. \\n\\nYou're still in a semblance of your Earthly form, still experiencing Heaven through a semblance of your Earthly mind. Nothing and nobody is new. Not only is it not new, but you've experienced everything so many trillions of times that pleasure, joy, and other positive emotions - no matter how Biblically epic - no longer have any meaning for you. Time means nothing. Other beings mean nothing (even God, who - according to the Bible - is so unknowable and infinite that He could never mean anything much to a human-ish mind to begin with). Again, you never physically or mentally tire in Heaven - those are clear Earthly limitations - so there is no sleep for you in a human sense. Which is a pity, because sleep would be a refuge from the only emotion you could possibly be experiencing at this time: boredom. Endless, unimaginable boredom. If only there was some way you could close your eyes and sleep forever, fade into nothingness. If only death were really real. The closest you can get to the comfort of nothingness - of death - is to float in an empty space, eyes closed, thinking of nothing. You especially try to avoid the one thought that claws at the back of your mind: the thought that, even after a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years, you are not even 0.000000001% through your time in Heaven. You will literally be here for eternity. \\n\\nThis is the reality of the Christian afterlife as I understand it. In my view death - an infinite nothingness - would be way, way better.

Though people can have a \"homosexual\" or \"heterosexual\" preference, since we all start from the ability to like either gender naturally, we all potentially do.\\n\\nI also believe that these people also should accept that they too can have a \"homo/heterosexual\" desire despite their normal preference due to what bisexuality and \"love is love no matter which gender\" is.

I believe that it is because of the fact that video games are a relatively very new medium that people have a stigma against it, not for a majorly negative reason. like how the TV was referred to as the \"idiot\\'s lantern\" when it first arrived in the American home, people just don\\'t like newfangled technology, until it becomes so commonplace that we see no problem with it ruling us.\\n\\nAs an example to further illustrate my point, I have heard a story of a person who would play games on his computer very surreptitiously, and whenever he heard his parents coming to his room to check on him, he would quickly turn off the monitor and jump to his bed to act as if he was watching television instead. His parents of course spend multiple hours in the evening lying or sitting on the couch watching TV, something he found very hypocritical of them whenever he was criticized for spending too much time on his computer. \\n\\nNow I\\'m aware there are lots of factors to account for, such as eye strain when staring into a bright screen, and carpal tunnel, but my point is that doing a reasonable amount of either reading or video games is no more detrimental one way or the other. Obviously playing video games instead of doing homework isn\\'t good, but so is reading a fun fiction novel. \\n\\n*(slightly anecdotal)* There\\'s also a negative stigma I\\'ve found when people identify as a \"gamer\". I\\'ve seen people (on reddit mostly) say that they \"cringe\" whenever they see someone identify as a \"gamer\" and say that its silly to identify yourself by one silly hobby. Whereas if someone were to say that they enjoy reading books in their spare time and spend as much time as they can reading new fiction or literature, then that person becomes interesting, and they have a fun quirk about them. One of my female friends even openly said to me that if someone says they\\'re all about video games she isn\\'t interested, but if they\\'re into reading books then she wants to know more about them.\\n\\nA video game and a book are obviously different in that a book is an imaginary world through reading words which form pictures in the mind, and video games are a visual and interactive medium, where an imaginary world is still there but more concrete. In fact, I\\'d argue a video game may offer more benefits in some situations, because it encourages hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, pattern recognition, spatial awareness, and actually a lot of theory. My friend who played the MMO World of Warcraft for 4 years is extremely good at math because he gamed the market system so well, and he now wants to become a stock broker. There is a lot of planning, strategy, and statistical evaluation that can go into just a single teamfight in League of Legends, not to mention the theorycrafting that comes with different items which offer different bonuses. \\n\\n**Video games allow so much creativity, use of so many different skills, and can deeply engross someone into a story or experience, but for some reason that\\'s not an activity you should admit to often doing.** \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That\\'s why I used \"primarily\" in the title. I also know that some of these types will survive if they were to give up or go against their ideals. (Pick up a gun, etc.) The overall point of the CMV is that those who cling to those leftist ideals won\\'t *generally* survive long term. So I will not argue with you over semantics or word usage.

Help me sort this out, would ya?\\n\\n\"Animals do not know any better, so they cannot be blamed for their actions (i.e. hunting and eating other animals)\"\\n\\nI would think one of the premises for the existence of rehabilitation efforts in prisons, for people who once felt it was okay to injure or kill other human beings, is that criminals can effectively be taught to \"know better\". Therefore, a person who believes eating meat is immoral should feel that the same rehabilitative efforts should be made for animals who hunt other animals. As they are, it is natural for them to hunt. However, it is also natural for murderers to murder when they commit their murders. We need to change what is \"natural\" for them -- reform the animals so that they no longer feel the need to prey upon others.\\n\\nOf course, aside from the fact that this sounds a bit silly, I believe it is impossible to do. This would therefore lead a person who believes eating meat is immoral to the conclusion that predatory animals need to be put down, the same way that murderers who we deem cannot be rehabilitated would be issued a death sentence. Perhaps locking up carnivorous/omnivorous animals for life-term sentences could also suffice? In any case, it would seem that severe and immediate action needs to be taken.\\n\\nThe only way I feel you can get around this is to find a successful way of reverting wild animals\\' intrinsic tendencies to hunt others. But again, I do not feel like this is a realistic possibility.\\n\\nMaybe I am just a bit tired or out of it, but I am strangely and surprisingly convinced by this line of reasoning. Thoughts?\\n\\n**EDIT:** Not that it was really coming up in discussion so far or anything, but I did want to mention that I am pescatarian, and also support vegetarianism and veganism. Just a bit of (possibly unnecessary) background on me, if anything.\\n\\n**EDIT 2:** This might be a clearer explanation of my view:\\n\\nLet\\'s just consider Person A who believes eating meat is wrong because it takes the life of another sentient being without its consent. Animals who hunt other animals take the lives of other sentient beings without their consent. Therefore, Person A believes that these predatory animals are doing something wrong. Person A should then feel that it is right for these animals to stop doing something wrong.\\n\\nThis may or may not represent my stance entirely (I am not quite sure myself), but it is at least a good summary of it.\\n\\n**Final EDIT:** I think I am fairly satisfied with how this CMV turned out. Thanks for all your replies! It was simply a strange thought that I felt would be fun to try to argue about, but the CMV yielded some interesting conversations, at least for me.

Through traditional stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, gender creates a categorization of behaviors, qualities, and images as belonging either to men or women.

The rhetorical techniques and structure of the group reminds me strongly of other hate groups that have existed for decades before. I also recognize that GamerGate is in a huge state of change right now and a large number of their members deny or fight the hate group elements of it. I believe the contingent that are actively fighting against the hateful elements are too naive to recognize the process, and therefore will not be able to control it.\\n\\n* The majority(not all) of GamerGate are straight, white males. This demographic has traditionally been the most prone to joining hate groups.\\n* Much of the rhetoric within GamerGate is designed to create a false \"we\\'re under attack\" mentality. This is a common technique used in the indoctrination process that makes it more acceptable to lash out at the target. This siege mentality is not based on reality because \"gamers\" by definition do not suffer from life threatening deprivation, they can spend money and time on games.\\n* Anonymity and group action makes it easier for any member of this group to lash out in ways they wouldn\\'t ordinarily do in their day-to-day life. \\n* Demonization and dehumanization of the hate group\\'s targets make it more likely and acceptable that extreme action would be taken. A 2 minute google search into Anita Sarkeesian will turn up all manner of extremely hateful and dehumanizing language against this woman who hasn\\'t committed any actual crime.\\n* Dehumanization often involves accusing the targeted group of crimes or holding up examples of the worst behavior from that group as the norm. Much of their discussion about \"SJW\" involves using the most koo-koo people from that movement as mascots for \"SJW\" and feminism as a whole.\\n* A common characteristic of hate groups is that they operate using different facts about the world than the average person does. In many of these groups you see that their idea of \"what feminism is\" is vastly departed from the mainstream ideas of \"equal \\n* Many hate groups are reactionary in response to changing demographics. In only a few years the influx of females has brought the gender ratios to almost 50/50 down from 90/??? and our cultural definition of the word \"gamer\" has not yet caught up. Many of these \"gamers\" feel their identity is under attack. Hate groups appeal to the primal need to fight encroachment.\\n* Hate groups usually have some sort of leadership, but do not require it. GamerGate has no official leader but instead have a rotating cast of e-famous personalities that endorse and influence the movement. A number of these personalities are known to already be bigoted in various ways, and most(if not all) of them are right-wing. Not all of them are vicious.\\n* Hate groups usually pick their targets based on some characteristic. This is where GamerGate is less clear. I don\\'t buy the argument that it\\'s an anti-woman hate group. I believe the clearest pattern that\\'s emerging is that it\\'s an anti-feminist hate group. Feminist women are the most common targets and often the recipient of the most vicious behavior we have seen from the group. The level of viciousness is on par with the level of credibility this feminist has in the mainstream, which makes sense if they are acting out of fear and lashing out, which is common for hate groups. \\n\\nPersonally, I have a background in both playing a lot of games(but I would hesitate to call myself a \"gamer\" right now) and hate groups(observing, not participating). I have lived my life in the American South and among the KKK(yes they still exist), and was privy to enough Christian hate speech to write a book. \\n\\nGamerGate rings a lot of the old alarm bells.

The label 'Agnostic' is often incorrectly applied as some kind of middle ground.\",\n  'delta_label': False,\n  'name': 't3_2k0wvs',\n  'selftext': 'My stance is clear by the title.  A person is one or the other, either a theist or an atheist.  Sometimes when the discussion comes up, and a person is called an atheist, they\\'ll reply with \"No, I\\'m agnostic\", as if they are mutually exclusive.  However, by my understand of the definitions, a person must fall into one of the two categories either in their professed beliefs or by their behavior.\\n\\nThe definitions I\\'m using are straight from google:\\n\\n**Theist:**  \"belief in the existence of a god or gods, especially belief in one god as creator of the universe, intervening in it and sustaining a personal relation to his creatures\".\\n\\n**Atheist:**  \"a person who disbelieves or lacks belief in the existence of God or gods\".\\n\\n\\nIt is my position that a person either believes in god (or other deity) and is thus a theist.  Or, a person does not believe in god (or other deity) and is thus an atheist.  I also consider behavior evidence of belief (or the person is a hypocrite).  So if a person behaves as if there is a deity they are a theist, and if they behave as if there is no deity they are an atheist.\\n\\nSo while a person may claim to be agnostic, stating that think that the existence of a deity is not currently know or is completely unknowable, they still fall into one side of the dichotomy based on either their professed beliefs or their behaviors.\\n\\nYou can change my view by demonstrating that atheist/theist is not a dichotomy and there is a third position aside from (1)Belief in a god or deity and (2)lack of belief in a god or deity.\\n\\nEdit 1:  I should further clarify the definitions listed above.  The definition of atheist includes both those who disbelieve and those who lack a belief.  Please correct me if I\\'m wrong, but disbelief is defined as \"inability or refusal to accept that something is true or real.\" and the lack (of belief) would be defined as \"the state of being without (belief) or not having enough of something\".  So a person who doesn\\'t ask the question about deities cannot hold any belief about deities, thus \\'lacks\\' a belief in deity and is thus an atheist.\\n\\n\\n*EDIT 2*:  Thank everyone for engaging me in this discussion!  I\\'m not going to be posting in this topic any longer.  As was pointed out by several people, I have expressed my view in such a way, and restricted the definitions I\\'m using in a way, that essentially makes this an impossible view to change.  I still stand firm in my view that there is a dichotomy that exists, either a belief in a deity guides a person\\'s behavior or it does not.  That dichotomy has words associated with each position, Theist and Atheist.  I still am not convinced that \\'Agnostic\\' is a valid position to take in this dichotomy.  Please accept my apologizes for presenting a view in a way that makes it unchangeable.

Only those cars triggering the cameras because of violations or having descriptions key to investigations have their license plates read and information scrutinized.   \\n\\nLessons from the Status Quo\\n\\nAs a culmination of TED talks so profoundly articulated in the National Public Radio’s (NPR) TED Radio Hour entitled “The End of Privacy,” surveillance is currently inevitable in the United States. First, the Supreme Court has created a messy web of rulings on privacy that leaves a substantial gray area for government surveillance. For example, Griswold vs. Connecticut established an implied right to privacy in the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Riley vs. California extends warrant requirements to cell phone content. However, Smith vs. Maryland disallowed the complete veil of privacy and permits government metadata collection. Second, private companies mine droves of consumer data with little current or foreseeable restrictions. The Economist of the United Kingdom asked the provocative question in the summer of 2013: Should the government know less than Google? The article makes the same observation as many others in contemporary media—corporate data collection is insidious and now unavoidable. The U.S. News and World Report and the National Journal discussed in 2013 that the surveillance state is largely a product of private surveillance practices. \\n\\nReform focuses on government collection (evident in the rise of the ACLU vs. Clapper case through the US Court of Appeals and public backlash against the Patriot Act and the National Security Agency in the U.S.), yet businesses conduct the bulk of data collection. The critical conclusion here is that some element of data mining is inevitable in developed/developing countries (many other nations are following the American example). This doesn’t necessarily bind nations to fates of surveillance in theory at first examination, but empirics tell us otherwise. In March of 2013, the New York Times reported that at least 25 nations have domestic intelligence programs, and there are numerous international treaties and organizations that are working to guide surveillance program development to avert tyranny1. Any realistic discussion of government surveillance must consider the scope of private surveillance in the status quo. \\n\\nPortrayal and Biases\\n\\nIn nations well read in dystopian novels, an aversion to government information control is understandable. But a cascade of colored media coverage and public cynicism only chokes off impartial discussion about government surveillance in society. Michael Hirsh of The Atlantic notes in his article entitled “Birth of the Surveillance State” that there is a war of perception waging between government agencies wishing to preserve their powers and media outlets looking to slander leftist “big government”. As a result, citizens have charged and incomplete knowledge of their government’s actions. For example, a poll conducted by MSNBC found that a minority of democrats favored government surveillance under the Bush administration, yet, seven years later a majority of democrats favored the same programs under President Obama. This demonstrates that the surveillance discussion in United States is too politically charged to be sincere and fruitful. The bias against government surveillance programs is formidable. In fact, there is a worrisome double standard in many developed nations with surveillance programs. The Guardian, for example, has discussed the media’s blind eye to corporate media mining while anti-NSA sentiments roar2. Google knows every user’s Internet habits, Facebook knows their locations, and Verizon knows the content and destination of their calls and text messages—metadata backlash is grossly overblown in this context. Truly, modern societies have a dangerous double standard and staunch biases that continues to hinder true discussion. As Judge Gerald Lynch of the Second Circuit of the US Court of Appeals stated just recently during the proceedings of the ACLU vs. Clapper case, “I just don’t understand the argument as to what’s so special about telephone records that makes them so valuable, so uniquely interactive, that the same arguments you’re making don’t apply to every record in the hands of a third-party business entity.”3\\n\\nSafety and Social Contracts\\n\\t\\nDiscussion of “justified” government actions revolves around governmental legitimacy and thus, social contracts. Political philosophers have developed theories pertaining to the role of governments and the balance of individual freedoms and societal restrictions for millennia. At the core of social contract theory is the forfeiture of absolute freedom for inclusion and protection in a society. Here lies the classic liberty versus security debate. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau discusses in his treatise Principles of Political Right, societies with social contracts requiring universal forfeiture of some liberties are idealistic because they facilitate a new breed of freedom. This basis of this freedom is security; safety via society furthers the human condition. Given this understanding, it is then one of the essential aims of any government to promote the safety of its citizens. \\t\\n\\t\\nGovernment surveillance programs dramatically improve the public safety and well-being. Looking to empirics, government surveillance is a critical tool in antiterrorism campaigns. We concede the fact that the United States has met many roadblocks with the NSA. Among others, there exists contention of the very basic effectiveness in thwarting terror attacks4. Surveillance programs are in their infancy, but we maintain that surveillance can and will be a counterterrorism tool in the future. As Paul Pillar of the Brookings Institute discusses in his article “Stop Bashing the NSA”, NSA-type programs are the product of popular demand for counterterrorism efforts. As communication becomes increasingly digitized, developed and developing nations ought to have a vested interest in surveillance programs. It would be foolish to dismiss the prospect of surveillance as a tool to arm governments in an age of increasing computer power and information availability. \\n\\nMost importantly, governments have an obligation to protect their citizens from insidious business practices. There are three entities interested in citizens’ information, and it is critical to maintain a perspective of their ultimate motivations. Simply, businesses generate capital from, cyber attackers commit crimes against, and government protects and serves the general public. People fear that government access to information only magnifies incriminating evidence. True, governments can and will prosecute when presented with viable evidence. However, Smith vs. Maryland obliterates the expectation of some variety of a “veil of privacy”9 between consumers and businesses. “The End of Privacy” also warns that businesses will manipulate consumers with their troves of data. Refer back to the discussion of the double standard. Government surveillance is the solution to private interest data manipulation. “The End of Privacy” describes data as capital and as such, supply and demand applies. Governments can eliminate corporate information monopolies and secure their stores against cybercrime through the collection of metadata10, 11. Additionally, governments can facilitate networking and innovation across vital sectors12. Citizens ought to recognize the potential for government surveillance and data collection programs to protect citizens from unfavorable business practices. Mass surveillance is ultimately representative of the contemporary power balance between governments and businesses. Disallow governments from controlling the lion’s share of public data, and citizens will render themselves powerless. Remember, citizen’s data is outside of their control and surveillance is now inevitable. Choose your actor: a private interest corporation with insidious business practices, or the government, whose job it is to protect and serve the general populace.\\n\\t\\nGovernments can enhance public safety with surveillance programs through other avenues too. In the United States, surveillance efforts are assisting with the war on drugs5. In fact, DEA and NSA cooperation is effective and increasing in frequency6. Justice systems stand to gain significantly from increased access to citizens’ information. As Jane Mayer of The New Yorker articulated, “metadata and other new surveillance tools have helped cut the average amount of time it takes the U.S. Marshals to capture a fugitive from forty-two days to two.”7 The United States Justice Department has commended the role of information from surveillance programs in increasing institutional efficiency8. \\n\\t\\nIn today’s age of diminished geopolitics and post cold-war era ideological factionalism, information infrastructure is indispensable.  There is unlikely to be any developed nation today who lacks ideological adversaries. As the age of troop combat and traditional combat wanes, the most valuable security assets are sophisticated technologies and programs like the American National Security Agency. Even if affirmative teams argue that surveillance programs are largely ineffective, the impact of a few intelligence successes justifies their presence. Recall that our advocacy entails only metadata surveillance for the majority of citizens. This trade is the core social contract theory. We maintain that the minor forfeiture of privacy outlined in our introduction is a worthwhile limit of absolute freedom considering the contemporary value of surveillance programs and their potential to enhance public safety. Ultimately, the preservation of even a few lives outweighs minor privacy concerns. Apply this concept to our utilitarian framework. Public safety is the epitome of utilitarian objectives. Trust in surveillance programs breeds peace of mind for the populace, which outweighs minor privacy infringements. \\n\\nIdealistic Shaping\\n\\t\\nWe contend that the vast majority of problems with and controversy surrounding government intelligence programs exist because of implementation errors. For example, court warrants for information scrutiny are a basic safeguard of public privacy, yet these programs are dubious in the United States. As the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) remarks on their website, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), “pose an increasing threat to individual rights,” because of secretive and unchecked authority.  As a result, Affirmative arguments will focus on issues of constitutionality, for example, but these discussions are ultimately frivolous. These arguments have an American premise when this is truly an international, ideological, and theoretical issue. Not all constitutions mirror that of the United States. The United States can and is reforming their system to follow international examples13. Even though the NSA’s actions have hampered American diplomacy in the short term14, governmental surveillance can become a tool rather than a weapon in the international sphere as demand amongst world powers grows. American-type programs that arise and engage secretly with legal dubiousness breed suspicion about government, this only corrodes faith and in turn, lessens democratic participation. Therefore, we should construct a theoretical state that has safeguards to foster trust. With empirics in mind, government surveillance can overcome its greatest barrier—public opinion.\\n\\t\\nThis carefully constructed surveillance state shall include many components. First, a surveillance constitution can avert an Orwellian-type slippery slope into dystopia. If governments adopt our definition of “mass surveillance” and outline ethical court practices for warrants, the American implementation empirics become null. Second, governments must construct a delicate security balance. Some degree of secrecy is necessary for the effectiveness and integrity of surveillance programs15. However, governments should disclose court proceedings and information not imperative to investigations. Third, the public and the government must be tolerant of watchdog agencies and whistleblowers that reveal lawless practices. These are the pillars of a healthy surveillance state. The affirmative teams must refute the premise of surveillance in a theoretical state without implementation barriers and with proper legal developments. Rejection of the status quo does not validate the resolution. That is to say, Affirmative arguments cannot use implementation errors as means to validate an affirmative position. Rather, they must refute the very concept of an ideological surveillance state. We have a unique opportunity to craft a surveillance state model that facilitates an unbiased discussion of mass surveillance. That is precisely what the topic asks. \\nIntellectual Freedom\\n\\t\\nNo discussion of surveillance practices can skirt concerns of intellectual freedom. In the face of government tyranny, oppression of unfettered discussion is a classic fear16. Media portrayal is largely responsible for fear of Orwellian dystopias. Public perception should be of surveillance as protective, not oppressive. Only those wishing to harm the public body will face scrutiny. Surveillance states do not inherently constitute a limit of sedition. Governments can craft laws to distinguish safety of public from rebellious discussion of their practices, thereby pacifying the “you have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide” slogan. Once the public differentiates the health of the populace from the health of government institutions, surveillance states can escape Orwell’s condemning fantasies. This view ought to be sewn into any surveillance constitution. Evidence of a planned attack against the British Parliament shall spur an investigation. However, plans to assemble outside Parliament shall not be infringed. Indeed, it is the perceived powerlessness of discourse and individual action that motivates violence against the state. Surveillance can aid democracies while being no more than a tool for safety.  \\n\\nA Shift in Judicial Paradigm \\n\\t\\nJack Balkin of the Yale Law School Legal Scholarship Repository argues in his 2008 article entitled “The Constitution in the National Surveillance State” that surveillance states pose a troubling transition from judiciary models of “ex post apprehension” to those of “ex post prevention.” Balkin contends that surveillance programs aim for crime prevention, and policing practices will come to defy constitutional safeguards if individuals do not have to actually commit the crime they intended to face prosecution. We find this logic to be flawed twofold. First, this shift of judiciary paradigm is not unique to surveillance practices. Many societies, including the United States have laws criminalizing malicious intent and planning (the basis of conspiracy offenses). These laws have existed far longer than surveillance practices. Second, we favor this paradigm shift and contend that if surveillance facilitates it, then that is only an advantage. Today, a single criminal can create far more damage than 50 years ago or the age in which the United States Constitution was drafted. In this sense, “ex post prevention” enhances public safety greatly by disallowing otherwise legally unstoppable actions.  So long as police maintain a credible standard for evidence needed to convict on the basis of intent and planning, then this shift is progressive. \\n\\nThe Wonder of Metadata/ TLDR\\n\\t\\nTLDR; \\nMass surveillance doesn’t necessarily have a significant impact in most citizens’ lives or privacy. In fact, metadata collection programs are hardly noticeable in the lives of law-abiding citizens17. This is the crux of mass surveillance’s potential. By using miniscule data from each citizen and analyzing trends, governments can preempt devastating crimes and locate convicts. Such measures will require minimal privacy infringement18.

It\\'s also a debate that usually centres around \"freedom\". Things always get heated when the concept of freedom is involved.\\n\\n**Those in favour of the ban**, usually argue that the veils are a form of sexist oppression, and a free society should not tolerate them. \\n\\n**Those against the ban**, usually argue that the women are having their religious freedom violated by not letting them where the veils.\\n\\nBut I don\\'t want to talk about whether the women under the veils are being oppressed. As a male without any strong ties to religion, that\\'s really none of my business. What I want to talk about is the French majority\\'s right to religious freedom. That is, to be *free* from religion. \\n\\nSomething not to be overlooked is the fact that **France is a less religious place than the U.S.** \\n\\nAs little as **4.5% of French people say they go to church every week.**\\n\\nAnd various polls show about a third of France to be self-identified Atheists.\\n\\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_France)\\n\\nCompare this to 20% or lower atheism in the U.S.\\n\\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States)\\n\\nOf those who *are* religious in France, Islam is much more prominent than it is in the U.S. From the same article, let\\'s consider that:\\n\\n&gt;Islam is the third largest faith in the United States, after Christianity and Judaism, representing 0.8% of the population.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the ocean: \\n\\n&gt;With an estimated total of 5 to 10 percent of the national population, **France has the largest number of Muslims in Western Europe.**\\n\\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_France)\\n\\n\\nAre you still with me? Okay. Enough with the stats, I know, they can be a headache when you see too many. The only reason I\\'m going through all this is because I didn\\'t want to make the unsubstantiated claim that Islam is MUCH more prominent in France than it is in the U.S. -- or in fact any other Western country -- without backing it up. \\n\\nSo what\\'s this all mean? \\n\\nWell, it means that as a country whose second largest theism is atheism, and whose largest religion, Christianity, is quite casual about it (hardly going to church) -- they are a state almost as removed from religion as any in our world today. \\n\\nSo as an ever-increasing number of Islamic immigrants arrive in France from North Africa and the Middle East, some of the more devout / extreme believers are arriving with veiled faces. And French people aren\\'t happy about it. \\n\\nBut it\\'s not about *hating* Islam. It\\'s about *hating* any form of theism that is directly in your face, on a daily basis, every where you go. \\n\\n**We can talk religious freedom all we want, but at the end of the day, if most French people want a society where religion plays a minimal role, because their culture has evolved this way, don\\'t they have the right to form that society?**\\n\\nI hope I\\'ve articulated myself clearly enough.

I believe that great improvements have been made as of 2014, but that the reverberations of past policies can still be felt. However, I don\\'t consider \"white privilege\" to be an accurate or a useful term. I\\'d suggest \"rich privilege\" or something to that effect. There are all sorts of victims and unlucky people out there, and not all of them are part of an officially recognized minority group. In fact, I\\'d argue that focusing only on members of minority groups is a form of the same flawed collectivist thinking that actual racists employed. In my mind, affirmative action-esque policies should target low income people regardless of race. A college admissions officer shouldn\\'t give special consideration to the black son of a neurosurgeon over the white son of a single mother (I realize some people might actually concede this point on the basis of who\\'s had more difficult circumstances, but may still argue for the former candidate in the name of diversity. While that\\'s a fair point, it\\'d be part of another discussion.)\\n\\nI don\\'t care for the term \"white privilege\", because it is blind to the fact that there are tons of white people from non privileged backgrounds. Some people may argue that even poor white people are less likely to be stopped by the police for a stupid reason, but I personally don\\'t see arguments like that as worthy of sustaining this \"white privilege\" meme. I think the \"We are the 99%\" movement succeeded because it resonated with everyone who had been locked out of the country\\'s power structure more or less due to the circumstances of their birth. But I think \"white privilege\" is divisive, and pits real people with their own unique challenges and difficult circumstances against others.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Here's how you did it:\\n\\n&gt;I find arguments which dismiss the opinions of males solely because they come from males, as well as those arguments that simply deal with female autonomy alone, to be highly unsatisfactory and completely ignoring the concerns of the other side.\\n\\nAnd also:\\n\\n&gt;There's disparate impact across a number of issues and voters are overwhelmingly ignorant when it comes to just about anything we can vote on.

Currently, I am taking the bare minimum amount of credit hours (12, to be exact), and I am enrolled in approximately five courses (General Chemistry II, \"third-Level\" Spanish, a PE elective, freshman-level English/composition, and General Chemistry II lab). Earlier in the semester, I was enrolled in Calculus I, but I chose to drop that course during my school\\'s \"drop-add-swap deadline\" (i.e. the time period in which it is possible for first-years to get a course removed from their schedule without a record of this appearing on the transcript).\\n\\nOut of the 5 courses that I am currently taking, I\\'m failing two (Spanish and General Chemistry II), and my grades in the General Chemistry II lab are close to the failing threshold as well. My other grades are fine, but my Chemistry and Spanish grades are pathetically low; on the midterm that I took four days ago in General Chemistry II, I scored a 20 when the class average was an 85, and my Spanish quiz was a 57% when the class average was an 81%. At this point, I\\'ve reached the middle of the semester, and bringing my grades up is a mathematical impossibility; although I do not have a formal GPA yet, my current low marks would probably place me in the sub-2.0 range. Technically speaking, I\\'ll be placed on academic probation at the end of the semester if I cannot manage to achieve the impossible and boost my scores; being placed on academic probation leaves a permanent record on one\\'s transcript, and even if I did manage a passing GPA, I\\'d be unable to register for most of my next-semester courses on the registration deadline (since I\\'ve failed to satisfy the prerequisites with passing grades). \\n\\nAs far as the other (non-academic) areas of the college experience go, I\\'m struggling from my non-existent social life and my deep amount of isolation. I spend 99% of my time in class, in the library, or in my room; at the current moment, I have only one friend, and I\\'m not terribly close to any of my acquaintances. Just today, seven or eight of the people of my dorm floor flooded into my room to welcome my roommate back from fall break; during this point, none of these individuals even bothered to acknowledge my presence. Whenever possible, I try to eat in the dining hall with my acquaintances, but it seems as if I\\'m making minimal progress in the process of integrating myself into the pre-existing social groups of my peers. There are additional *cultural* factors at play that may be complicating the process of making friends in my current environment, but that subject is too broad and lengthy for me to broach during the course of this discussion.\\n\\nOf course, my parents are very worried about my lack of progress and my failing grades, and I worry deeply about disappointing them. Education is very important to my family: both of my parents have bachelors degrees, and my aunt and uncle are (respectively) an organic chemist and an aerospace engineer by trade. My father is an incredibly hard-working, intelligent person; just a few months ago, he was laid off from his old job, but within a short period of time, he acquired *multiple* job offers for positions within his field (computer science). I wish that I was like my more intellectually gifted relatives, but I think that I should acknowledge reality. I cannot know the individual IQ scores of my family members, but I\\'d estimate that they tend to have IQs ranging from about 116-135. My IQ is barely 108, which makes me not even one standard deviation above the general population; the average IQ of a college graduate is 115, and the average IQ of a PhD recipient is 130.\\n\\nI\\'m a moron in comparison to my peers and my family, and I\\'ve always known this to be so from a young age; through luck and sheer effort, I\\'ve managed to surpass my limitations to achieve results outside of the range of my meager capabilities (such as my SAT score, which is beyond what someone with a 108 IQ should have). I\\'ve come far, and I\\'m proud that I was even able to make it to this level (despite all of the ominous statistics indicating that doom and defeat were an absolutely certain). Nevertheless, a rational person acknowledges when they\\'ve been defeated, and it\\'s more than time for me to put down my pencil and swear off collegiate life; I\\'m just not cut out for it, and I never was. It\\'s best for me to stop wasting my parent\\'s money and my professors\\' time, and I should just stop now rather than face the crushing humiliation of academic probation and inevitable dismissal. I\\'m not quite sure where I\\'ll go once I leave college, but I can probably think of some other usage for my skills that isn\\'t so improperly matched with my low level of aptitude for intellectual pursuits.\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

One of my frustrations when trying to discuss feminism or equality is that as a man i feel my ideas or opinions are largely ignored or attacked by women. I often get a  \"your a guy so you wouldn\\'t understand\". Not only is this aggravating but is hypocritical since equality would mean we all have an equal voice in the discussion, i digress. \\n\\nAnyways in trying to understand why these discussions so often breakdown i came to the conclusion that what one person considers equal another does not. This seems obvious but I don\\'t mean that a chauvinistic man who believe all women should be house wives thinks that that is equal. Instead i mean to say that me someone who wants equality for all people, believes that requires vastly different things than the women i\\'m talking with. \\n\\nTo better illustrate this point i think that equality would mean that everyone is given the same opportunity without bias; this means if your black and you are a better applicant than a white person you get the job, similar situation no matter the relation. Same goes for the law, if a man is held responsible for his actions while intoxicated shouldn\\'t a woman be as well. (I\\'m not saying if someone got her drunk against her will i mean if she made the decision to drink alcohol) But many would disagree with me and say this is not fair, that minorities and women need to be protected under the law so that the majority (us white men) don\\'t take advantage. \\n\\nSo i don\\'t think we can ever reach \"equality\" because due to peoples different opinions on what that means there will always be those who are not equal in someones mind, and discussions to reach it will not go far, at least not as quickly as they should. \\n\\nTo change my view should not be hard since i am not emotionally attached to this idea since i just thought of it. You either have to show that people ideas of equality are not fundamentally different (dictionary definition does not count) or show me that even with this difference in opinion equality can be achieved accommodating for everyones needs. There may be another way that you find so good luck. \\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We\\'d just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Gender equality is your issue too.\\nBecause to date, I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother’s.\\nI’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less “macho”—in fact in the UK suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20-49 years of age; eclipsing road accidents, cancer and coronary heart disease. I’ve seen men made fragile and insecure by a distorted sense of what constitutes male success.

A word is a symbolic tool humans use to convey meaning to one another. So we could argue endlessly about the true meaning of these words, but the simple truth is that we must acknowledge that these words, in the minds of millions of different people, have millions of different meanings, moreso than most words do. We all have a much better consensus on words like blanket, for example. \\n\\n\\nAsk most feminists and or most atheists, and they would tell you that they don\\'t hate men just because they are men or hate Christians for being Christians and that really what they have a problem with is the way women and atheists are treated in society.\\n\\nBut if you were to ask most people what they thought of feminists or atheists and most of them might tell you that these people are extremely intolerant people who hate men and or Christians and eat babies and pray to Satan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo in the future, you should avoid labeling yourself and/or allowing other people to define or label you with a word, as Neil Degrasse Tyson so eloquently put it, to assert they already know everything about you that they need to know in order to put you in the atheist or feminist or gamer or hippie box and end the conversation and understanding before the conversation ever starts. \\n\\n**That doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t ever label yourself**, but if you want to actually have a friendly conversation with someone who might be interested in learning more, be aware of what meaning you are conveying to most people if you wear the badge of atheist or feminist. You can argue until you\\'re blue in the face with people about what you really mean when you say you are an atheist or a feminist, but almost universally the connotation people have with these labels will still be stronger than your trying to convince them it actually means something less hostile than they imagine it to be. \\n\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I mean, I\\'ll click on the odd Facebook or Reddit link that interests me, and some of those *happen* to fall under the broad category of \"news\", but that\\'s hardly the same as (for example) reading newspapers and magazines, or checking the front page of BBC every morning. There might have been a time when I thought to myself, \"I should watch more news, because that would make me an Informed Person^TM who knows a lot about the World^TM\" but I found it just didn\\'t interest me, and when it did, it stressed me out (not because the news itself was depressing -- more on this later) so I eventually stopped. Long after that I felt guilty, but I\\'ve stopped feeling guilty about it.\\n\\n\"But you need to be informed!\" I sort of am. When I want to know about something, I look up books about it, or even just Wikipedia articles. Sometimes the books or articles cite news sources. Fine, but the difference is, *I\\'m* seeking the information I want, I\\'m not being told what\\'s important and what\\'s not. I\\'ve heard it said that the media can\\'t always tell you what to think, but they *can* tell you what to think *about*. This is a problem -- a classic satire of this is the whole \"Did Glenn Beck rape and murder a young girl in 1990?\" meme. Strictly speaking, whoever asks the question isn\\'t telling you what to think about whether Glenn Beck is guilty, but the fact that they\\'re asking the question makes it seem more likely that he is. You can find plenty of examples of this technique in the news, some of them less obvious than others.\\n\\nAnother big difference between books and news is the level of urgency we\\'re \"supposed\" to assign to the news. When large groups of people are given information without time to think, it\\'s easy to jerk them around. I\\'ve heard it argued that, if you don\\'t read the news, it\\'s easy for people to take advantage of your ignorance. But it seems to me that, if you *do* read the news, it\\'s even easier for people to take advantage of your biases to make you do what they want. As Mark Twain said, \"A person who doesn\\'t read the news is uninformed; a person who does read the news is misinformed.\" Call them what you want: witch hunts, circlejerks, mob mentality, tribalism. You\\'ve seen it happen; I hardly think I have to give an example of a large group of people overreacting to a piece of news because they didn\\'t think about it hard enough. Whatever you want to call it, I\\'d rather avoid being a part of it as much as I can.\\n\\nI know too much about my own psychology to read news. If I read a news article, I\\'m not going to get much value out of the article itself -- they\\'re designed to be short, and there\\'s not much you can say in just a few paragraphs. Noam Chomsky once said that one of the problems with televised news is that, when a segment is a few minutes long, the only points of view you can express are conventional ones. And this is before I start reading the comments on the article; there\\'s always some argument going on, and my brain picks a side before my conscious mind can tell it to suspend judgement. Everything is politicized, including whatever news source you\\'re planning on recommending to me in the comments -- the only difference is, some people know which way their favourite news source is biased and some don\\'t.\\n\\nI\\'d like to talk a little more about the alleged \"valuable information\" in the news. Remember when the Large Hadron Collider was in the news because the Higgs Boson had been discovered? A lot of my friends were sharing the news on Facebook. I guarantee you that fewer than 25% of those friends knew anything about particle physics (the number would be lower, but I\\'m a university student and I have a lot of friends who major in STEM fields, including myself) -- they were sharing it because they wanted to display how much they (fucking) love Science^TM. I noted that the articles existed, but I didn\\'t read them -- I would rather spend more time learning about particle physics, so that I know on a deeper level what the significance of the Higgs Boson is. There\\'s a story of a journalist asking Albert Einstein, \"What\\'s new in science?\" to which Einstein replied \"Why, have you already written about all the old science?\"\\n\\nA non-scientific example: Let\\'s take the protests in Hong Kong. I know very little about Hong Kong. I know it\\'s kind-of a part of China, but kind-of not? Something about the UK? Ultimately, all I\\'d get out of reading an article about the protests is \"Sometimes, when people are unhappy with their government, they protest\". I already knew that. Whereas, if I read a book about the history of Hong Kong (not a bad idea, actually) I\\'ll gain more perspective on exactly how Hong Kong is connected with China and the UK, why they might have reason to protest, what their culture is like, what their government is like, and so on.\\n\\nI\\'ve been praising books for a while, and you might respond, \"But most books are researched by journalists, or people who take their information from news sources!\" True -- I would argue that a good book about a current event should cut through the noise and notice what\\'s really important about the event. Most news, on its own, just isn\\'t very important. I don\\'t believe for a second that anybody is going to be thinking about Ebola or Gamergate in 1 year. However, I think news sources might be doing a valuable service by providing a steady stream of information in the first place. I also think the New England Journal of Medicine is doing a valuable service by publishing medical research, but I don\\'t read much medical research either.\\n\\nA lot of news sources boast that they have up-to-the-minute or up-to-the-second information. But I\\'m not convinced that I need that much data. Most things in the world aren\\'t happening to me right now, and if an event really has long-term importance, then chances are I can get away with waiting a little while to learn about it. In fact, I would argue that it\\'s better to have some time pass, so that you can try look at an event more objectively, without having other people scream in your ear about what you\\'re supposed to think.\\n\\nWhy do I want you to CMV? Well, naturally, I\\'d rather be right than wrong, and if there is actually a good reason for me to pay attention to the news on a regular basis, then I\\'d like to know what it is. It seems like a lot of other people are interested in it, including my friends and family. But I\\'m not seeing what value they\\'re getting out of it, and I\\'m wondering if maybe *I\\'m* the one who\\'s wrong.\\n\\nI predict that there will be two major points of view expressed in the comments section: (1) \"If you don\\'t want to read the news, just don\\'t read it! Live and let live! What\\'s the matter with you?\" and (2) \"Reading the news is really important, and I cannot possibly allow you to continue living without the glory of news!\" I\\'m tempted to say that these two groups of people should be arguing with each other, not with me.

I am excluding musical theatre, modern (phony) opera singers and anyone that borrows from those styles.) When I say music, I am excluding these people.\\n\\nOkay so to explain my disclaimer, opera singers and musical theatre actors need to project, which takes serious skill and practice. Techniques like belting are used, which have to be specifically learned and mastered. Opera singers (even phony microphoned ones) use techniques like bel canto, which are really difficult. They dont fit into what I am gonna explain.\\n\\nSo I dont respect most singers because they singing in music because the singing isnt actually very difficult, and even then it is so subjective that anything can be considered 'good'. Singing is simply a muscular contraction, you train your vocal chords to output a certain pitch and timbre. My point is that anyone can learn to sing. With a bit of vocal coaching and minimal effort, I could be (technically speaking) as good a singer as most successful musicians.\\n\\nMany people have a naturally 'nice' sounding voice, since in the music industry, things like projecting, vocal stamina and breath control arent important, these people are naturally as good as many singers. How can such singers deserve respect? \\n\\nNo one picks up a guitar and shreds solos like Page. No one sits down at some drums and plays like Peart. Yet the vocalists in many bands are by far the most famous members. They get far more respect than they really deserve.\\n\\nSo it is clear that almost anyone can become as technically proficient as a famous singer. However I strongly doubt, even if I put unfounded amounts of effort in, I (or almost anyone) could be as good a guitarist as Hendrix or Clapton or Gilmour or Page or Beck or any household guitarist. These people would still be the best in the world.\\n\\nFurthermore singing is so subjective. People can have wretched 'breathy' pop voices, that are technically just bad, but these people are revered as good singers. While song instrumentalists have poor technique (like Slash for example, he would play without his pinkie finger), they can still emulate the same results, they are just handicapping themselves.\\n\\nSingers earn too much respect, they are often the front man of the band, despite being the far from the most talented member. John Lennon is the most famous Beatle, while most fans would agree he didnt influence the sound of the band as much as McCartney or Harrison. Mick Jagger is pretty unexceptional as a muscian, yet he gets most of the fame, whereas Richards is one of the best guitarist ever.  \\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I should clarify that I think generations of consoles are fine, as they are merely improved and updated machines. However, CDs (not so relevant), mp3s, dvds, blu rays, apps, are all largely fluid and run on nearly all machines. You can run iTunes on any computer, watch a blu ray on any blu ray player, and run most apps across both Android and Apple phones. But why are games restricted by the machine you own?\\n\\nI think the industry would greatly benefit from a single console or games that played on all consoles that were practically identical in terms of specs (blu ray players, dvd players, etc), and the publishers focused on the games instead, and used that as the focus for competition. Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo all sell their hardware at a loss and make up the sales in software, so shift the focus to the software rather than what the console can and can\\'t play.\\n\\nI don\\'t play PC (I know. I\\'m a filthy casual.), but Steam seems to, undeniably, be the most sound gaming concept there is. A host site that has all games from different publishers that can run on any PC, and play any game, provided your machine is powerful enough. I believe a similar model could exist in the console space.\\n\\nYou can probably tell that this is hard to put into words, but I can\\'t help but feel that console exclusivity is a largely dumb concept that anyone outside gaming would quickly say something like \"Why not have all games everywhere.\" It would help broaden the market and not confuse people with which game needs which system.

      "\t\t>>\t You are also assuming there will ever be a \"post scarcity\" period...  There is very little data supporting the idea that automation = less job opportunity overall.  There is some data that automation advances in a a given industry can reduce job opportunities in that industry for a period however there are very few instances where this is not made up for in scale. I.E. higher automation leads to growth in the industry which then leads to it hiring more people again, despite needing less people per unit produced. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Two things: A post scarcity economy is not defined by the absence of jobs, but by the lack of economic need for them.   Secondly, the automation I am referring to does not have a historical precedence. This is not about replacing a weak human welder with a untiring robot, this is about replacing the slow human brain with an efficient and specialized ai. In many fields human intelligence would be akin to outdated technology. Think of how horses were replaced by the superior automobile. Very few horses still work today, because they are only viable in verry narrow circumstances. The same will occur for humans, and like the horses, there is no real reason we will find new work just because we lost our economic value.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t No the automation you are talking about has many historical precedents.  Machines replace humans when they become better or more efficient at a job then a human could be.  You are merely talking about a state when there are no jobs left that are better done by a human.  However I am saying that this will never happen because throughout history when machines have taken over for what we are doing, this merely causes us to come up with something new to do. After some time we come up with a way to replace this new activity with a machine and so on and so forth. \n",

Resources become a lot less finite at that point.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Why? Economic value can not be forced onto a tool. When we have the technology that makes any possible task currently done by a human more cost effective, why would there be any need to hire humans? What can a human do that ais can not do better? Theoretically, nothing. In reality there are some functions that will take longer to automate than others, but time will eventually see all human labor as economically antiquated.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Because humans have an innate drive to do stuff. Horses never did, horses did what they were told to do, we dont, we do what we feel like doing. It used to be that everyone was a farmer, than technology progressed, now almost no one is farmer. Now we do other stuff, we do stuff that people in the 1500s would have though impossible or absurd.  So its probably safe to say that 500 years from now people will be doing stuff that we now think is impossible and absurd.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t A drive is not enough if there is no possible oppertunity for it to succeed. I dont think you understand what I mean by automation. All humans do as workers is use their intelligence or strength to achieve goals. The human brain is akin to an organic computer, and we can design ones that are superior to it. The human muscle is nothing compared to machines, so all manual labor is also becoming unproductive. What does that leave for humans? Nothing large enough to employ the global workforce, or any significant proportion of it.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That is what someone in the 1500s would have said if you told them that in the future no one would ever have to farm again.  \"What else is there to do?\"   and then you would say  \"Well you can make huge contraptions made out of the black stuff that fire makes that fly through the air at 100x the speed of the fastest bird.\"  And they would tell you to go get your head checked.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Because no limit of human usefulness was conceivable 400 years ago does not mean that limit does not exist. If someone from 2400 told me of the things they were doing I imagine it would be equally astounding, but I doubt these tasks would be being done by humans.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t See this is where I lose you.  \"Human Usefulness\" is irrelevant, we don't need smart phones, we don't need airplanes, we don't need luxury watches or fancy suits or any of it. There are millions of things that exist and are beloved that serve no use in terms of base survival (reddit for example). But we do them because we enjoy it, I can create a machine that plays golf better than I play golf, but then I wouldn't get to play golf.

But if you, for example, participate in a mission trip to convert people to your religion - then I absolutely think you ought to be judged.

I might hate the color pink, but I wouldn't say that to someone wearing pink, because they'd be offended.  But I can hate the color and think it is ugly without hating the person wearing it.  I definitely hate organized religions that teach false things.  It doesn't mean I hate the practitioners of it, because they may be confused, or duped, or just following what they grew up with, or any number of reasons.  Likewise, I am not particularly offended if people hate MY religion.  Even though it is, of course, true, they don't KNOW that it is... why wouldn't they hate what they (wrongly, of course) believe to be false and therefore harmful?  But neither they nor I need to be dicks about it.  I don't go up to people and say \"I hate your religion\" because they would be offended.  They would take it personally because they identify so strongly with their religion that an attack on one they perceive as an attack on them.  And maybe it IS an attack on them... but the view was that one could do so without hate.  I can definitely attack a person's beliefs without hating that person.  I think Islam is a false, destructive religion.  I bear no hatred towards muslims.  They probably wouldn't *believe* me when I say that, but that's up to them.  I wouldn't tell a muslim I met \"I think your religion is all lies and people are going to suffer in hell for following that false prophet Muhammed.\"  They would be upset, and that is a predictable thing.  But hating the religion doesn't mean I hate the person.  Maybe I even hate some of their opinions or thought processes.  But that still doesn't mean I hate the person.

Funny, this is how religious people think because in their eyes they are objectively right because \"God\" or whatever has the final say in what goes on and is their basis for morals instead of common sense/logic. (Which was in short supply when those religions were created in the first place) These days we know murder, rape, paedophilia, etc. is unanimously wrong.    The reason why it's so hard to talk/debate with some religious people is because they think they're in the right because of what some human wrote down in lieu of \"God\". Some of them don't want to change while others conform to humanist/secular thinking of the modern world. (Moderate/liberal religious people)   I think instead of hating people/ideas and having black and white thinking they should treat each situation as it comes because morality is totally subjective. As I said earlier, what we might see as wrong, murder, etc. other's might see as an excuse to express their religion, birthright, opinion, etc. in the form of whatever they might please.

I think the recent \"Interview\" (Seth Rogan/James Franco) movie is a good example.   Now just because shit flinging is in the movie doesn't mean that movies should make a ton of money, but society should strive to create venues (like movie theaters and magazines) where there is no limit to the amount of shit flinging one may encounter.    Another good example is reddit.  I am not personally subscribed to the 'iamgoingtohellforthis' subreddit but I am glad that a venue like reddit exists and where that type of discourse is boundless.

      "\t\t>>\t The problem here is that you're only looking at an isolated incident where the scenario is already playing out.  That's kind of like talking about the concept of mutually assured destruction with respect to nuclear weapons by only talking about the impact of a missile hitting a city.  The point of a MAD scenario is that the threat of retaliation is so strong that you are deterred from acting in the first place.  For the extreme case, if literally everyone was carrying a gun, and everyone else knew this, it isn't unreasonable to propose that people would feel less confident trying to pull off an armed robbery or a shooting in the first place, and so the situation would be avoided entirely.  [One town passed a law requiring everyone to own a gun, and their crime rate is now half what it was prior, so it's not a completely random postulate.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennesaw,_Georgia#Crime_statistics)\n",
      "\t\t>>\t See, you say this. But if a shooter opened fire on a crowd, and it was you and your family there, would you still feel the same way? That you're glad nobody else has a gun?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Yeah I of course considered a scenario similar to the one you outline, however I think that the gun owners would be prepared to deal with these situations and their risks. The simplest thing is only to return fire if someone is firing on you or those you know have no intention to kill somebody.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I was focusing on that scenario because it's the one proposed in the OP, not because I think it's the strongest individual argument for gun control.  Kennesaw is an interesting piece of anecdotal evidence, but such a specific example that I've never given it much credence as a predictor of how increasing gun ownership would change society.  It might work in some small towns, but most places aren't going to have the same results.  They actually seem to be proving that since their crime rate is now increasing as their population goes up, though there could be other factors as well.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Depends on what goes down.  If there's some Jason Bourne type in the crowd who just pulls and puts the guy down right away I'd be thrilled.  But I think that it's more likely that someone who isn't prepared to deal with the stress and chaos of the situation will probably do more harm than good.  And the more people in the crowd all acting on their own, with no knowledge of which other shooters they should be shooting and and which ones they should be helping, the worse the situation is going to become.    I think that scenario is more likely, especially if we start encouraging a social norm that as many people as possible should be prepared to open fire at a moments notice.  So I'll play the odds and say that we should avoid a culture with that expectation.  There may be a few shootings that go on longer than they would have in OPs proposed world, but overall there will be far fewer deaths if we don't go that way.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That is far, *far* easier said than done.  If you aren't looking at the shooter when the shooter opens fire, then the average civilian has very little chance of correctly responding to this situation instinctively.  A lot(I would guess a majority) of people are going to perceive anyone shooting in their direction at all as a threat.  Say the shooter enters at one end of the room and someone at the other end returns fire.  How are all of the people in between to know that the second guy is trying to hit the criminal and not them?  I know you said that you think these people should be trained, but how much training do you think is reasonable to expect before we give them a gun, especially if we want to get such a huge number of people armed?  To be able to respond in a situation like that requires constant training and practice, and it's not realistic to expect so many people to do that when they aren't police or military.  It's just not realistic to expect a full fifth of our population to be able to react like SWAT team members at the drop of a hat.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t What you are asking for amounts to a trained police force, yet you went out of your way to say you don't want to arm the police force exclusively for fear of a police state. How would this be any different? These people with guns would still be the ones calling the shots (literally). Whether or not they correctly identify the right shooter (which is incredibly hard even with training, much less without), they will still be shooting to kill people. This will only increase the deaths in each mass shooting since more people will be doing the shooting. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t In any emergency situation, the only thing more gunfire, no matter how well intentioned, will do, is add to the confusion and increase the victims. I know if I were a terrorist looking to shoot as many innocent people as I could, I would love for someone to return fire at me - having 20% of the crowd begin firing at each other in the confusion would be a wet dream. They'd probably end up killing more people than any single terrorist, no matter how well-armed, could hope to do.  I'm pretty certain that if you went to any professional gun convention or NRA meeting, and began shooting at people, everyone with a brain would simply take cover and wait for the cops to come. Because they know guns and they know the *worst* thing to do in that situation would be to use them.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t It certainly is, but the OP was proposing that mass shootings could be mitigated by having a large number of citizens who are prepared to return fire, which is(in my estimation) simply not the case.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I really liked your explanation, and OP's non-answer was pretty hilarious. It sounded like a politician dodging a question.   I always have a similar sort of critique to anyone arguing for guns as a personal safety/protection tool. Guns escalate situations, and make people more unpredictable. It sounds so silly to me when people suggest they would be increase their safety by winning some sort of James Bond gun-fight over an imaginary foe.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I think it should be something of a level of the police training. Completing it should have benefits maybe even outside of the social stature.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t It would be different because the people with the guns wouldn't live among the policemen day by day on their paycheck, in short they wouldn't be policemen and share (most of) their problems and incentives.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well that is my point that the negatives you are envisioning wouldn't happen often enough to outweigh the benefits, as the people allowed to have the guns would understand this and wouldn't be just a common Joe who decided to get a gun on his way home from work.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Guns only escalate a situation *if they're brought into it*.  There seems to be a common misconception that those of us that carry actually WANT to use deadly force.  People seem to think that we'll pull at the drop of a hat.  While there are undoubtedly a few a-holes among us that do, the *VAST* majority simply do not think that way.  In point of fact, *most* people who carry understand the weight of the tool at their disposal.  We understand that if we believe the situation warrants use of a gun then we've decided this is a life-or-death situation.  Thankfully, most average citizens, gun carriers or not, never encounter such situations.  Speaking for myself, I only have once in my life and it was more than 25 years now... and, I managed to survive it without a gun.  But when you do, the alternatives are facing it with a tool that we all know is effective at it's job, or going at it without that tool.  Even though I survived my one such case without a gun I wouldn't want to make the gamble a second time.  No, the truth is that most people who carry understand that carrying a gun makes you the pussy in the room.  It makes you the person that backs down from any and all confrontations long before they escalate to the point of needing a gun.  They understand that they are the ones that take the insults and just walk away.  We keep our anger in check at all times.  We're also the ones that are paying attention to our surroundings at all times, not burying our faces in our phones and whatnot, because we understand that situational awareness is the key to staying alive whether you have a gun or not.  We notice the little details.  We move to the other side of the street if we think we see trouble coming (whether it \"looks bad\" or not).  We're the ones that, more importantly, won't even *BE* on that street in the first place.  Like I said, I'm sure you can find examples of people who carry who do so with the wrong mindset.  But if you spend any time around people who do carry you'll quickly realize those people are few and far between.  We're perfectly normal people, just like you, who just so happen to not want to be in a situation where we can't defend our lives.  Simple as that.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Yeah, police officers that I've talked to have told me that if shit like this goes down civilians should run.  If they can't run, they should hide.  Only when options one and two are out of the question does engaging become your best bet, and even then it's only because option four is get shot.  They also said that if option one or two ever present themselves again, take them and get out of dodge, and let the police do their job when they get there.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Except police training isn't like riding a bike.  You don't just lean it once and then you're good for life.  Being prepared for an active shooter scenario is gonna need constant practice, both mental and physical.  Most police officers wouldn't even be prepared for these kind of situations, which is why we have SWAT teams that specialize in those kind of scenarios(I'd also like to point out that if we wanted to train millions of people to SWAT levels of proficiency it would be comically expensive and I have no idea who would pay for it).  Add in the fact that the situation would likely be even more stressful than the average SWAT raid since the civilians have no knowledge of any of the other participants and were completely unprepared in the moment, and do you still feel that training which would necessarily be brief and infrequent enough to allow for these people to have other jobs would be extensive enough to mitigate dangers I brought up?  Because I just don't see that happening.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I say that they would share more incentive to abuse their power. They aren't policemen, they have no job description forbidding them from abusing their power wielded with the guns. Just because you wouldn't does not guarantee these people would make the same choice as you\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well I don't think this it is required to be SWAT-level trained, it isn't hard to teach people if not sure just stay on the safe side and don't pull out the gun and shoot. It should be standard to pull out gun only when you are going to shoot, so if someone aims at you you know his intentions and everyone would know this so they won't be stupid and aiming at random people.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well there already are a bunch of people who legally carry guns, aren't cops and there haven't been any significant number of reports of them abusing their power, while there have been lot of reports of cops abusing their power and criminals carrying guns.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Do you have any evidence to back up that assertion?  Because I've seen videos of people who just went through gun safety and combat training accidentally shoot themselves and each other with their paintball pistols when an ambush was simulated immediately after being told their course was over(can't remember where the videos were, I'll add them if I can find them later).  You seem to be handwaving how easy it would be to train people to go against their survival instincts and maintain a detached situation awareness in the face of death.  It takes months of training for both police and military before they are ready for active duty, and then they have constant ongoing training and evaluation to stay sharp.  Why would it be easier to train more civilians in less time?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t But the difference is that right now the people carrying the guns are not expected to uphold the peace. They have no power to abuse at the moment, but give it to them and they will abuse it, that is human nature\n",
      "\t\t>>\t You need to consider that in shootings maybe even the death counts per shooting would be same or maybe even a bit higher, but if it decreased the number of shootings so that the total death count from shootings would decrease it would be a success - the role as a detractor is important.  It would be easier to train civilians because their role is fundamentally different from the police. They would be only in role of defenders, not chasing down criminals or anything police and SWAT do. They perhaps would rarely be able to stop the first deaths of a mass shooting, but should be more effecting in stopping subsequent deaths.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t How does expecting them to defend themselves and those around them against attackers give them power?\n",

Why haven't more guns in USA equaled fewer mass shootings?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t You are assuming that spree shooters are going to rationally decide not to commit their crimes because they fear that they might be killed.  This is flawed logic.  Spree shooters are essentially always either killed or captured immediately following their crime in the culture that already exists.  Spree shooters know this before they do anything, and will often leave manifestos behind in anticipation of this.  Spree shooters either are irrational actors who believe themselves to be invincible or the exception, or they intend to die and want to take as many people as they can with them.  There have been many shootings in gun free areas, but there is no indication that the shooters would have just decided that they didn't want to commit mass murder because the chances of their survival or escape(which are minimal already) are lowered.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t What you're saying makes sense, but there's something I don't understand about your hypothetical. The bacon sandwich is presumably a metaphor for a printed image of Muhammad. This would mean that someone, somewhere printed such an image publicly that caused the Muslim extremists to react. If this was done benevolently, such as for education or out of ignorance or anything other than satire or malice, then I emphatically agree that the artists at Charlie Hebdo were to be lauded for their fight against censorship. But I feel this may be being overly reductive, so would you mind shedding a little more light onto the origin of this first bacon sandwich?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t The first bacon sandwich came about because 90% of the world (made up statistic) has no problem eating bacon, just like there's a sizable percentage of the world that isn't offended by images of Muhammed and isn't prohibited by any law (religious or civil) that says they can't draw them.  So they did.  They made that bacon sandwich.  In the real world, Jews see people eating bacon sandwiches all the time and don't care.  They're not going to do it themselves because their faith forbids it, but they're also not going to try to tell you that YOU can't have a bacon sandwich.  And they're damn sure not going to murder you for it.  But in this case, the reaction was to threaten violence and murder for eating that sandwich.  So, in response, scores of people said \"We'll be damned if you're going to scare us into not eating bacon sandwiches just because YOU don't think it's right.  We're ALL getting bacon sandwiches!\"\n",
      "\t\t>>\t \"somewhere printed such an image publicly THAT CAUSED the Muslim extremists to react.\" No, someone CHOSE to react to a printed picture. Every day someone may hurt someone else's feelings, but as rational and respectful human beings, we let it go.  The first \"bacon sandwich\" can exist for any reason whatsoever and requires no justification or apology.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I think the only purpose on satirizing the muslim prophet is in establishing that nothing is sacred.  If one thing is considered sacred then it is up to some arbitrary line over which you get executed for expressing yourself.  It is important that that line doesn't exist.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t So basically, The World saw a Big Red Button in the Muslim faith and couldn't help but press it. So, we started it.   Now, of course, any rational human being would say \"that offends me, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that\" instead of \"I'm going to decapitate your whole family.\" That's where my sympathy stops, and I re-side with the rest of The World.   But basically, you walked into a Deli and overheard the shop owner on the phone with his wife saying \"Boy, does bacon offend me.\" Then you step up to the counter with a devilish grin and say, \"I'll have a bacon sandwich. Haha.\"   Whether the shopkeeper simply frowns or pulls out a shotgun at that point is moot, as far as my argument goes. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Bacon sandwiches have some purpose, represent some good to the people consuming them. That is in fact the primary purpose of consuming a bacon sandwich. It is *possible* to be offensive while consuming a bacon sandwich, but that is not the intention of most people eating bacon sandwiches.  The purpose of these cartoons is not nourishment or enrichment. I would argue that their primary purpose is not even entertainment. They exist for no other reason than to insult a group of people. You can choose to be a dick to someone, and you don't deserve to be killed for it. But no one should pretend like you're a hero for choosing to to be a needless dick to a group of people.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t No, you're playing it like someone found out that Jews don't approve of bacon, so opened up a bacon shop in the middle of their community and went around laying bacon on everyone's doorsteps.    The point here was never to antagonize anyone.  We didn't walk into a clearly Jewish deli and, with a big asshole grin on our face, say \"Give me some bacon\".  We were sitting in a deli that proudly serves bacon, and someone walked in and demanded that we not eat it.  Just like these cartoons weren't published in the parts of the world where they would offend.  They were published in western countries where freedom of expression is an understood concept.  It is the offended parties who showed up and started screaming.  The battle was not taken to them, it was brought to us.   Your analogy would be more apt if we had gotten these cartoons into the papers in Saudi Arabia, or flown over the area dropping paper copies of the cartoons onto Muslim communities with the sole intention of pissing them off.   \n",
      "\t\t>>\t the difference is its not illigal or wrong for non muslims to do so, they holding us to a standard they chose is not our problem  also, newspaper is not an individual or group, so its not targeted, offense isn't given,  people take it because it suits their ways,\n",
      "\t\t>>\t No, we portrayed Islam and Muhammed truthfully in documentaries and political cartoons. They islamists went crazy and the west started to do it as a fuck you, we will do what we want \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Satire IS  valuable end. Ideals that wish to be immune from criticism are the ones which should be criticized the most.  The cartoons 10 years ago were not intended to'offend' merely to criticize.  Many of today's cartoons also contain valuable commentary and criticism, also being a big FU to those who want to prevent an image of a guy being published. (I can only assume because of the fear of accidentally worshipping him as a false Idol).  Cartoons that didn't mock muhamed are just as inflamatory as those that do.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That's not true at all.  Political cartoons don't exist just to piss people off and make fun of people.  They've been around for centuries as a way to make an editorial point in a way that words can't effectively accomplish.  They *do* exist to persuade, to educate, to encourage conversation.  There are undoubtedly plenty that DO just aim to piss people off, but to say that anyone drawing a political cartoon is just trying to start a fight is incorrect.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t What the OP is looking for you to confirm or point to is innocuous, non-antagonistic comics etc. that just happen to picture the Muhammad.  That is the \"first bacon sandwich\" he meant.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t You're changing the level of generality here to shift the debate. Yes, political cartoons absolutely have a purpose, no one is arguing otherwise. But the cartoons depicting Muhammad in a crude and vulgar manner only exist to inflame and insult. I have yet to see one cartoon that depicts Muhammad as a racist Arab caricature that serves a higher purpose.   In a free society, people don't need a high purpose to publish anything they choose to draw. This much is true. But we should not paint these cartoonists as martyrs. They intended to inflict pain upon a community. You might not recognize the psychic pain of a Muslim who loves Muhammad and sees him depicted as a crook nosed rapist as something worthy of your contemplation, but that doesn't mean the pain doesn't exist.   Some individuals in the group these cartoonists intentionally hurt chose to retaliate with violence. This is of course inexcusable and an order of magnitude worse than the original offense. The men who did this deserve no quarter in any civilized society. But a civilized society should likewise not canonize the original malicious intent of the cartoonists as a form of nobility.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well, I doubt you're going to find any comic that isn't poking fun, since that's the point of a comic, to illustrate a point, but the comics in question are no more offensive than any other political cartoon that pokes fun at every other religion imaginable.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/things/depictions-of-muhammad-examples.htm  Clearly done in a much more tactful way, but also technically fulfilling your request. I would point out that what the OP is looking for is much harder to get a clear bead on. Basically we would need to pair such an image with someone attempting to censor it, which requires digging into very recent history (usually incredibly obscure).\n",
      "\t\t>>\t We've come back full circle to the beginning of this discussion.  There are two different sets of cartoons in play here:  1) The original political cartoons years ago that started this backlash against cartoonists depicting Muhammed.  These cartoons were not meant to offend.  They weren't drawn as just some crude and vulgar way to incite anger in people.  They were drawn, like any other political cartoon, to make a political point.  The response from Islamists was \"You can't do that because our faith forbids it.\"  They responded with threats of violence (and in some cases actual violence.)  2) Later cartoons that were drawn in counter-response to those threats.  These are the comics about which you're now talking.  The ones that definitely ARE meant to make a strong point and offend.  Those comics are very much standing up for free speech since they are a direct response to those that seek to take that freedom away through violent means.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I think OP is just an apologist.  It doesn't matter whether people were trying to offend the Islamic faith or it's followers.  The point is that these comics are always meant to offend someone, and people of the Islamic faith think they should get special treatment because they have a law against it.  Printing an image of Muhammad is just as much standing up for free speech as newspapers printing \"Jesus never died for your sins\" in the hypothetical world where Christians killed someone over writing that. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t The full circle is actually a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where one negative action begets a further destructive response. This isn't rhetorical: what was the point of the original Muhammad cartoons? To show \"them\" that we could, their feelings be damned? Something else?   Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should do something. My contention is that the original cartoonists used their right to free expression in a nasty, childish, and destructive manner. The response was a crime against humanity and I don't want to blame the victims for that, but we should not be glorifying the provocateurs as martyrs who upheld our values. No, they abused them.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t > Why do you need to keep doing it? I agree that people should have the right to say and print what they wish, but why do you need to be a dick for no reason?  They had a reason. Satire like that is generally used to depict the absurdity of a social or political topic or situation in ways, that can't be expressed as well by other means.  In the case of the recent Mohamed caricatures were in response to the death threats issued to earlier caricatures (that had a different intent, that is irrelevant to this). The caricatures were openly mocking those death threats by existing, throwing the attempt to censor artists in the face of those extremists. From a more abstract point of view, they further revealed the absurdity by inciting more death threats.  In short: Those initial death threats (and not the offence of moderate Muslims) was the reason for the caricatures. They were an statement of resistance against the attempt to suppress opposition by death threats using the means of satire.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That world not hypothetical. Christians have indeed killed people for blasphemy. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t > My contention is that the original cartoonists used their right to free expression in a nasty, childish, and destructive manner.  And that's the part I take issue with. The cartoonists that drew these are not Muslim (presumably).  They don't live in a Muslim country, they didn't grow up with Muslim culture, and they don't live under Muslim law.  So they drew cartoons lampooning something just like they do politicians, celebrities, and other religious figures, because where they live and grew up, there's nothing immoral about that.  Your morals are a function of the culture you grew up in.  They didn't do it to antagonize.  They did it for the same reason they draw anyone else.  To make a political argument.    The point of the first cartoons was not to show anyone anything.  The point of the LATER cartoons was exactly to \"show 'them' that we could.\"  \n",

But what about when you've answered a philosophical question correctly?

No.  Philosophy is absolutely not as refined as any other field.   Because you can not test your philosophies, you cannot improve them.  Because you cannot improve them, they remain unrefined.  The basic cycle of philosophy is, hundreds of years ago, some guy wrote some things.  End of cycle.  Ever after people read that philosopher's works and bicker over the many obvious flaws.  Nothing ever gets refined, because while there is obviously a lot wrong, you cannot satisfactorily pick out what is right and what is wrong.

How should we govern?  What is justice?  These are all fundamental philosophical questions, that, despite centuries of effort, are entirely unanswered.  As a challenge to philosophy: Name the biggest accomplishment in the past ten years for your field.  Fifty?

For $500, of course the apple laptop is the worse deal because it doesn't exist. But I'd much prefer Apple's $1000 laptop to other $1000 laptops *for personal use*. That's partly because Apple's $1000 laptop is a genuinely phenomenal machine - even when I'm surrounded by more powerful or capable computers, I often choose to use my MBA instead because it's so much nicer to use.  On the other hand, I would not buy a Mac mini over a comparably priced PC desktop. The mini just isn't as good for the price as the MB is. And indeed, I own a MBA and a desktop PC for those reasons. In their classes, each was the best value for me for that price range.\n",

If I'm going to wear boots once a month, it's sensible to get the $20 Walmart boots. Same functionality, 1/5 the price. But if I'm wearing boots 12 hours a day for the next 2 years, I want boots that are comfortable, reliable, etc. That comfort and reliability is worth an extra $100 or even $200 to, say, a handyman. Since I use my computer constantly, I want a computer that gives me the most comfortable usage. That's what Macs are good for. That's worth the extra $3-500 if you're a power user, hell, it'd be worth the extra $800 if your price claim wasn't ridiculous to begin with.

You can get similar specs for half the price, but if you spend what you would've spent on the Apple you can get better specs and similar build quality.  OS ease of use is pretty subjective, though.

Apple's \"unibody\" chassis is almost impossible to repair. Aluminum is very rigid and smooth and pretty, but it's not the most practical material.  Aluminum is Apple's schtick.

I suppose I'll just have to agree with you there, but then again I'd argue that if you're looking for time well spent, Reddit probably isn't the place. I think it's kind of fun trying to change someone's opinion on a matter, especially if they're really stubborn about it.

You might be able to refine your own criticisms of an idea or acquaint yourself with some argument against your view you haven't heard before. At the very least, you get practice dealing with stubbornness and stupidity, and that's good practice because there's clearly no shortage of those two attributes among people.

When most people lose an argument in the way that arguing with grandma can be considered a loss, they come away as frustrated, and even further attached to their opinions. Why? Because they feel as if they are talking to a wall, a stupid wall that cannot grasp the intelligence of the thought. This is why voters have a low turnout rate and every text post on /r/politics approaches maximum characters. People feel that it is harder to get into the minds of the others, and so, they respond by increasing the length, intensity of rhetoric, vocabulary, facts, etc., to the point that /r/politics text posts cannot even be considered to be true because they are so editorialized.

At my university (in Denmark) we operate with both \"formal preprerequisites\" (i.e. you must have taken this/these specific course(s)) and \"suggested background/academic qualifications\" (i.e. you should have knowledge in these areas). The former is rarely used, and usually only in situations where it would be literally dangerous to the students if they don't have proven qualifications (e.g. if they are to handle dangerous equipment/materials/chemicals in a lab). There are also formal prerequisites on your secondary education for being enrolled into the degree program.  We don't have a problem with people scores of unqualified students in courses. Consequently it doesn't lower the level of the entire class either. At least not according to student evaluations and the teachers. Anecdotally, I've also taken many coursed and been a TA on a few, and none of them had the problem either.  Students know they'll get slaughtered if they enroll in a class they're not qualified for. The few people who do anyway just fail.  I've been vicechairman for our study board of mathematics and computer science for about two years. Some of our responsibilites are quality assurance and development of educations as well as defining the degree curriculum for educations within our area that are offered by the university. There is no data to support that we suffer from your hypothetical problems. As vicechairman, I also (along with our chairman) coordinate with the study boards for the other fields under our university's Faculty of Science, and they don't report having those problems either.\n",

This creates more demand for the class which makes it even harder to get into. Its bad for the students that are not prepared and its not fair to the students that are prepared but aren't able to take the class because so many people are failing and retaking it. Often times professors have the option to waive a prerequisite if they think that the student is adequately prepared for the class in question through other means. This option has always existed. The fact that some professors choose not to use it is usually based on their own experience, observing how students without the prereqs do in their classes. While this may harm some high achieving students, as a general policy it also benefits all the other students trying to take the class. Its not a perfect system but its better than the alternative. \n",

Now this is most common in mathematics and I have never seen this available for things that require labs but it never hurts to ask.

There is a significant difference between criticism, which can range from constructive to rude to destructive, and shaming, which is not only destructive but must also carry a significant amount of weight to qualify. Additionally, the exception for criminal acts is based both on the distinction of it being an action and the harm that laws are (ostensibly in some cases) designed to prevent.  As such, to state that we should not shame anyone for possessing an immutable trait is not to say that we cannot criticize, nor is it to say that we cannot shame them for actions clearly delineated as destructive.

The major difference between these and empathy is that they are much easier to change. For example, a child who has never been exposed to sufficient emotional information will be unable to develop the neural networks necessary to process it. This is evident when comparing children raised in environments where emotions are frequently being acknowledged and discussed or not, and also children who have been neglected. Although training can improve it somewhat, if they are too old they will basically never be able to process emotions normally. Often they suffer Alexithymia as a consequence as well.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t What you are referring to is the idea of [cost-push inflation](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/012005.asp), which is an increase in the cost of production factors causing a decrease in the aggregate supply.  Wages are just one of many factors in inflation and aren't really even the largest one. Businesses still have to deal with adjusting prices from almost every other commodity as trades occur in the market. I fail to see how the labor market is any different from another commodity.   Automatically adjusting wages would create some inflation but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. A small amount of inflation encourages people to spend money instead of saving it which spurs economic growth. Keynes best described this as the paradox of thrift where saving money hurts the economy.  The Fed would still have plenty of other tools to control inflation not the least of which is the interest rate. Recently getting the inflation rate to go up has been much harder than bringing it down.  Full disclosure: I'm not an economist either but am interested in economics.\n",

The money that goes to higher wages is taken partially from less pay to owners, less product being bought and forcing employees to be more efficient.\n",

They all influence each other in many different ways. Thats what unions are for, historically, to be able to control the prices of the labor market.  Exactly and the biggest driver is monetary policy. Even though costs would get pushed higher through wages if I can't get a loan to open that second location or have to pay a high interest rate I will be deterred from doing so. This will reduce demand and help keep inflation in check.  The thing about unions is there are many cases in which they have actually backfired. Strong unions created such high costs that it lead to outsourcing to countries which didn't have that problem.  > I am personally against minimum wage completely, as I believe it actually hampers the labor market.But you did mention in the OP that this is a discussion you don't want to get into.  Yes exactly. It's not that I don't care about people's responses to this it's that I believe it will be a distraction from the the idea of auto adjustment.

Don't go together. The poor were *not* paying \"Nothing\" before. in fact they were paying a lot.  Food stamps are paid for by the government through taxes. Some of those taxes come directly from the bottom 40% of income earners (about 10%). So right off the bat they're paying 10% of the price of those food stamps (because money is fungible).  The remainder of taxes are on things like income, capital gains, inheritance and payrolls. These are not *directly* paid for by the bottom 40% of income earners. *But they still pay for those taxes through higher prices*. The exact same mechanism that, in your eyes, passes the burden of a minimum wage onto low income and fixed income people (prices) also passes the burden of capital gains taxes, income taxes, corporate profit taxes etc... Not *all* of the burden is passed in either case, but a fair amount of it is.  Are they, on balance, paying more than they were before? Definitely not. Why? Because everyone making minimum wage got a raise. Everyone making just above minimum wage probably got one as well. Everyone who shares a household with one of these earners got a raise. These people are overwhelmingly (for obvious reasons) low income earners.  *Part, and only part* of that raise is cancelled out by higher prices.

A psychopath may want to instantly kill millions of people, but the rules of MAD still apply. Psychopaths are extremely self-centered and knowing that they would probably die as a result of firing the weapon would be enough to deter them from doing so. They are also very intelligent and would know this before joining the program, likely choosing a different path to fulfill their urges.  Additionally we have to remember that psychopaths make up 1% of the non-prison population in the US and the majority of them never become violent.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > Hypothetically there's nothing to stop a non-centralized fringe group from using a nuke in a terrorist plot if they could ever get their hands on one.  A non-centralized fringe group that has sufficient organization to get hold of nukes should have at least one person level-headed enough to realize that the threat of a nuke is worth more than the visibility of having used one but no longer possessing such. After a fairly short period with access to this threat, any capable group would have territory of their own to defend and would fall under MAD.  This doesn't mean that the threat of a nuke being acquired by such a group is not substantial, just that it is unlikely to manifest in the actual usage of the nuke.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Even if they aren't particularly enamored with territory, using force to bring about their ideals generally means competing with others who would use force to eliminate their group. Control of territory removes this threat and allows them to enforce their ideals within that territory. The threat of a nuke holds the other force at bay. The use of the nuke will usually fail to fully destroy the other force and invites it to attack.  The difference between a nuke and a terrorist attack is that the terrorist attack has to be demonstrated before being treated as a credible threat. It has no power without at least a one-time implementation. The nuke is a credibly proven threat by the simple proof that one possess the nuke. Possession of an ICBM delivery vehicle increases the threat greatly, but isn't strictly necessary for it's existence.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I think you're vastly overestimating the value of territory to some of these groups.  That, and just because a group controls a piece of territory doesn't mean that they actually hold a claim to it.  Example, if ISIS were to nuke the US or Israel that doesn't mean that we'd be able to respond with a counter nuke of ISIS territory since Iraq, Syria and other actual countries still claim ownership of those regions.  You can't nuke ISIS because that would royally piss off the actual countries who claim sovereignty over those areas.  You're also forgetting that a lot of these fringe groups are highly mobile and spread out.  Take AQ for instance, they've got strongholds in several countries in several of the Stans, Yemen, Iraq, etc.  So if they coordinated a nuclear attack on the US where exactly are we supposed to retaliate?  They're simply not concentrated in one easy to invade area.  Heck, I would be willing to bet that if we nuked every known stronghold simultaneously that they'd still have a few that we don't know about operational.  These groups just don't operate like states.  You simply can't retaliate against them like you would against an actual state.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t All of this is why territory is only part of the equation. Prior to attaining a solid and defensible territory, the group is substantially vulnerable. The ability to threaten with a nuke to accomplish a defense of their group or even gain concessions from once-enemies is a great boon to such a distributed group. Territory provides other options with which to obtain these things by force, and is the only reason it must be considered.\n",

The manual labor requirements aren't shrinking too fast, but they are shrinking.  The localized labor is the part that keeps towns/cities functional.  When the big labor users automate it has big impacts.    Chili's and others are testing automated tablets for you to handle everything yourself, so you can get rid of waiters and just downgrade to bussers, which will be paid less and get less tips because they aren't providing as much service.  Stores had mixed success with self checkout, but they will continue to improve them until they are the norm.  In 5-10 years you will simply walk your cart up to a register and it will read the RFID chips and have you swipe your card and go.    Yes, people work longer hours because companies can push their employees harder, companies LIKE you to be afraid to lose your job.  Fear that a single illness will put you in the poor house is great for labor management.  Keynes isn't completely wrong, there is a lot of inefficiency in the system on purpose... people make companies that do similar things to other companies, so diversification of things like clothing and cars help keep labor busy, for now.   \"It hasn't happened yet\" is not a solid argument.  Automation is happening faster, and we also added in a global work force.  3D printing, cheaper robotics and more complex automation will have a major impact in the next 20 years because the government will have to solve the growing underemployment problem one way or another, and the moment large corporations don't have the ability to take advantage of their employees they will quickly reduce their need for them further.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t I don't agree, the technology didn't exist back then to be able to fully automate things like building cars. Now, we have extremely precise robotics and computer systems that are complex enough to adapt in real time. It's easy to use your imagination when thinking about the potential long term effects of a new thing/behavior and be pretty accurate. So, I don't think the fact that it didn't happen 80 years ago is any indication about the likelihood of it happening now.  On the other hand, not all industries are really susceptible to automation. For example, the medical industry requires bedside manner which is the obvious thing preventing automation. Medical workers rely on their ability to get important information from patients who are vague, deceitful, or simply don't know enough to concisely communicate their problems. On top of that, emergency medical workers work in some of the most unpredictable environments that exist. The physical dexterity in tight spaces coupled with navigating an unpredictable terrain is enough to make robot ambulances a monumentally difficult thing to achieve. It's possible it would happen eventually but it will require not only better artificial intelligence than we are capable of making currently as well as a complete overhaul of the way we build houses to allow a robot to even access most patients in the first place.  Compare this to something like fast food or manufacturing. Flipping burgers or even cooking complex dishes can DEFINITELY be reduced to a repetitive process that a machine could accomplish.  I think people will experience more of a shift of desired expertise rather than a complete elimination of people from jobs in the near future. At least until technology improves further. Eventually, it WILL happen. \n",

The taxes will just have to be high enough for all to get a reasonable income. And since progress has only come with higher productivity so far, we will probably see fewer people earning much more - paying more in tax. But even taking all that into consideration we still have not seen this technology that makes us jobless and poor effect in real life. Only uneducated people have suffered the people not able to adjust, learn or move to better jobs. So why do we expect this effect now? Trade barriers to protect jobs such as mining and steelwork has not improved the economy it just made sure that some people could continue doing their old job and not finding a new job. Even Detroit is adjusting and becoming a rich city again, just smaller.\n",

First of all companies often don't make choices in accordance with comparative advantage.

Second of all, human productivity will be a rounding error compared to the sheer power of machines.

I recommend you read Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut since his world is a bit like the one you propose but morale is a huge problem.  Third, efficiency is meaningless if you have more efficiency than you could possibly use. The earth has a finite amount of resources and a finite amount of consumers. If the machines you have can process all available resources and or make more than enough goods to meet demand and still have time when they are not needed than extra efficiency isn't particularly helpful.   Last but not least, employees strike, they need benefits, there are safety regulations, they bother you to buy girlscout cookies.

Society began with the idea that everyone working together and contributing to a pool of labor would allow everyone to get ahead collectively. As such, what you contribute to the pool of labor is essentially your value to society, whether that be through picking up and putting down heavy things, inventing, fighting off other societies, entertaining others through art, etc.  As we reach post-scarcity, that correlation starts to dissolve. We don't really need everyone to work as hard as possible anymore. However, as a society we know of no other way to value people, so we create busy work for them to do.  The most apparent example is that politicians are constantly talking about \"jobs\" as if they're important, when all that really matters is quality of life.

One excel spreadsheet does the work of an accountant in significantly less time, for a fixed cost of one week's pay for the accountant.  With phone answering systems, dictation software, wordprocessing software, etc, that's another job replaced at the cost of a month or two of pay.  File Clerk?  Windows has a search function, and you don't have to pay nearly as much to electronically store the files (even if you're paying for a data back up facility).

No, not really.  The jobs in the production of making our lives better have been replaced steadily since the industrial revolution (for the relevant country).  The automation revolution (which history will say we're in the dawn of) will push everything to the service economy, a transition that was observed as having started under Reagan.    The problem is that a service economy is completely unsustainable without input from outside sources.  A Barista quite simply cannot afford to get coffee from another barrista often enough to keep all barristas employed, especially when a computerized espresso machine gets to the point where it can replace a starbucks employee.   To see examples of this, take a look at any tourist town.  Alternately, take a look at any town where the major industries have fallen on hard times.  The Rust Belt, for example, or Detroit.  See, the problem with Automation is that it's going to, eventually, hit *every* major industry.  It won't be a question of exporting Steel jobs or Manufacturing jobs... it's going to be a question of replacing basically *all* jobs.  If machines can replace us in making most of what we do... as jobs become more tenuous, people will be more careful about what they do with their money, meaning that the machine made cup of coffee that costs 50% but is 90% as good as the human made one will become the preferred choice, thus putting even barristas out of jobs...\n",

The other two are useful as abstractions but do not seem to match up to how our brain actually works.   The 3-stratum model says that intelligence is really an emergent property that we see by looking at narrow specific abilities, which in turn layered up to broad abilities, and that all that together the whole of these broad abilities is our IQ.   In the AI field, specific narrow abilities have definitively increased. As just one example, chess computers can now regularly beat the world champion whereas 40 years ago they couldn't beat a decent club player. Since the stratum model says intelligence is an umbrella that covers these layers, and the lowest layer has increased, under this model computers are unarguably more intelligent than they were 40 years ago.   The other two models follow similar analysis, so I won't go into them here. But basically, as far as cognitive psychology goes -- computers are doing better in measures of intelligence.   Now you might say that passing electrons around in a brute force algorithm isn't the same as really playing chess so that isn't intelligence. But the reality is that it is the same. That is the point of the Turing test. While the underpinning computations are vastly different, the functional result is indistinguishable from an external perspective.   We don't pretend that computers are intelligent because they have a really big biological brain. We understand they are silicone and copper and plastic and metal and function at a low level much differently than humans do. But the resulting output is indistinguishable from highly intelligent human action. And that is how we measure intelligence.   Cars aren't slower than humans because they don't have legs to run on. They are still faster than humans around a track. Likewise, computers are smarter, much smarter, than they were 40 years ago, and they are on pace to put us to shame in numerous areas very, very soon (and in many areas they are doing so already).   The computer program Eugene nearly passed a formal Turing test this year for human language interaction. He convinced 10 of 30 expert judges that he was a human being. It won't be too long before that number climbs to 30 of 30. Computers aren't more intelligent than us generally, yet. But as each of their narrow specialties becomes better and better, and as networking computers together becomes easier and faster, it will not be long before a computer, or network of computers, is superior to us at every human task.   I'm not saying next week. But if the advances of the last few years continue to show as much promise as they have, the next few decades will be game changing.  \n",

And automation will have little impact on the creative fields. Automation is useful in most fields because it is cheaper and more efficient than hiring a person. In the creative fields, however, the only important factor is quality of the final product, I.e., it's ability to sell.  People won't buy a cheaper song just because it's cheaper, they'll only buy music they like.  Thus, the chief advantage of robots over people is nullified in this field.  Sure, you may see automation in certain creative areas, writing jingles, advertisements, etc., but robots won't replace people altogether in the creative fields on their price point alone.\n",

We have made essentially no progress on the Hollywood style strong AI. Right now, a computer cannot be truly creative. You can teach a computer the rules of how to put something together, and give it a method to determine the quality of an example, but you can't generalize that. If I want a computer-generated prog metal opera then I'm gonna have to sit down and write everything about how to generate such a thing, figure out how to programatically appraise a given example, and essentially define a very powerful but very dumb machine.

I don't really get your all computers and all humans point. Babies can't drive either. All that matters is that the computers that we have driving us around know how to drive.  You are right on the music thing because people like the idea of celebrities but the fact that computers can do it still means they are intelligent and can simulate creativity.  Computers don't publish original research because they don't care about anything so we have to tell them what to do. Computers play an increasingly indispensable role in science and research of people I personally know is based almost entirely on computer simulations.  First of all, genetic algorithms can make better genetic algorithms, it is experimental and it is called meta-genetic programming. You are right though, I know very little about meta-genetic programming, only that there is work on it. Second of all, the quote of mine you called a bald faced lie is basically the definition of genetic algorithms. Better is subjective and by better I meant in terms of the fitness algorithm. If you include efficiency in that algorithm somehow then the genetic algorithm will improve in that respect.  The thing that is impressive isn't that it is walking it is that it is walking simply by flexing the \"muscles\" shown. In computer games the walking is a simple animation.  I am not an idiot. I know computers work by preforming operations on binary data and the human brain sends impulses across neurons and they are very different. They are still both information storage and processing systems and they can often accomplish the same tasks. Also with computer systems we can simulate brains.

Humans are incredibly cheap, self-reproducing, intelligent robots that are capable of doing most tasks that machines can do. They can survive on a couple of dollars of beans and rice a day, and live 10 to a hovel. It's extremely unlikely that machines will ever be able to price them out of *all* labor.

The speakers in these commercials is shouting at the viewer, not merely declaring the wonders of Arby's sandwiches in a deep voice.  > [N]o one believes that a large man is going to bust through their TV set to fight them.  True, but people have emotional reactions to what they see and hear even if it's merely on TV, in a movie, or in a book they've read. Some people may react to loud, aggressive commercials with some amount of stress. And for what gain?  > Are you sure that potential customers are building negative associations? I mean, could it be that the average person *identifies* with the voice?  Well, I suppose I would have been a potential customer, yet Arby's commercials have dissuaded me.

What if, and bear with me here, pulling the commercial is a bad move because your reaction was atypical?  I never felt that the voice in that commercial was angry. It struck me as the kind of voice used while exercising or playing sports more than anger. We all decode things differently, but I honestly don't get where anger reading came from there.  People who react to aggressive commercials with stress have a serious problem, because if they are being seriously stressed by commercials then they would be seriously stressed by daily interactions with people on the street. We shouldn't be coddling those people, we should be actively helping them to manage the cause of those problems.

      "\t\t>>\t When going up against an officer it's pretty much guilty until proven innocent. Everyone is inclined to believe the word of an officer against an alleged criminal.   For the situations in which officers should not be wearing cameras:  Undercover: If it's about cover being blown by a visible camera, would a microphone not suffice? And for situations in which wearing any recording instrument could jeopardize the officer's life, like entering a drug fortress, we can assume the officer wouldn't be using any brutality, either.  Courtroom: This is not a place where many conflicts between officers and citizens take place. And if they do, it's a courtroom, full of witnesses to testify brutality.  Confidential informants: Why not record? It's the police department that's organizing the meeting. They already know about the informant. If anything a camera/microphone would prevent an officer from twisting the informant's statements. The department wouldn't be relying on memory. Forgive me if this particular case is a whole new can of worms and should be addressed elsewhere.   For domestic violence outreach, I don't really understand what goes on there but I can't see how a camera would damage the mission.\n",

So I think his system makes perfect sense - assuming the cop is acting properly, he should always have the camera on. The only cops that benefit from body camera malfunctions are the corrupt and abusive ones.  Thus, we should assume that camera malfunction means possible abuse or corruption. This creates incentives where the good cops wear reliable cameras and keep spares on hand in case of malfunction, whilst the abusive cops are much more easily identified by repeated camera blank spots and repeated incidents of tampering with their cameras.  Finally, you're right that there are plenty of situations where police should not be expected to wear body cameras. That is when you take them off.

He gets in a shooting and ends up killing a suspect.  Goes in to turn his video footage, and the camera didn't record properly.

It was used most importantly(to the story) on the oldest, most central tree. The first tree. The tree that provided the seeds which eventually became the entire rest of the [4]chard.  This tree, and those similarly doused with pesticide, began to produce rotten [apple]s each harvest. It began with only a small number of [apple]s per harvest, and the rot seemed to be exclusive to those trees. In a short time however, it was evident that not only had the poison began to spread via the old trees' central root systems to the rest of the ever-expanding [4]chard, but that the pesticide was ultimately ineffective at eradicating it's intended target. Ironically the pest would prove to be *so* persistent that it eventually developed a taste for the fruit of the poisoned trees in particular. So while ever-present throughout the rest of the [4]chard, the insignificant pest that was deemed capitally offensive to the young garden in it's infancy eventually took up primary residence in the very trees that drastic measures had been taken to protect.   Over time, while the [4]chard continued to grow in the number of trees and overall quantity of [apple]s produced, each harvest produced more and more rotten fruit and less and less quality, refreshingly unique [apple]s. A symptom of the original poisoning invading the root system of the entire [4]chard, it wasn't long before trees throughout, even those planted years later, would begin to exhibit signs of the same ills.   Today the [4]chard has massively increased in the number of trees on the plot, but the the overall quality of the fruit has experienced a noticeable and rapid decline over the years, with the discovery of truly fantastic and deserving [apple]s becoming more infrequent overall. The trees that were originally exposed to the toxicity are mere husks, crawling with parasites and very rarely producing fruit worth eating. They can't be cut down now for the same reason they were praised and admired long ago. They're integral to the root system of the entire [4]chard, and representative of the great and original idea that was the foundation for the [4]chard itself.    If you've the time and patience to sort through all of the semi-fermented garbage hanging about and don't mind trying to ignore all of the annoying insects who've invaded the place, a brilliantly creative or otherwise distinguished specimen of an [apple] can still be gleaned from this hopeful collective that once seemed to have limitless potential. Unfortunately it's rarely worth the effort to look anymore.   tl;dr: OP's right.\n",

But to gain a sense of meaning in their lives in a manner which is very circumspect.  And my point was that it had nothing to do with shame, or even equality for that matter. The movement was about *equity*, not equality, two very different things. Most people are totally ok with a wealth gap. Most people are not, however, totally ok with [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Inequality-by-Kenworthy.png). That's an absurd growth for the upper class, and there's no argument that their contribution to society is worth *that much more* than the entirety of the other 99% of the population. Until you can disprove that premise, you have no right or reason to chalk it all up to a hurt sense of self worth.  > But this is the internet  Oh, I'm sorry, I guess that makes baseless arrogance totally ok. Carry on /s.  > I was reflecting on the irony of how politicians are treated when the typical individual would look far worse under a spot light  Would they now? Can you back that idea up with facts or does that statement just \"feel\" right to you?  > I was especially challenging the perceived idea that they felt undervalued through democracy  And I'm saying they felt the 1% was *overvalued.* Not that they were undervalued.  > The 99% as a literal group will have very primitive opinions that in general do not often change and when they do it's mostly because of not liking the opposition. That is a reactionary measure, not aware of its actions. Not trust-able to act in accordance with sensibility.  Again, this is equal parts arrogance and sheltering. You're implying that because someone is wealthy, their opinions will naturally be more nuanced and intelligent. I have friends ranging from poor to rich, and I can assure you, I see no significant correlation to their economics and intelligence. Neither I nor my opinions are any better than any of them simply because my parents make more money than theirs. That's an utterly absurd concept.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Heartless? That's not at all what I was saying.  Honestly, it's hard not to argue strawmen when you're not entirely sure what the other person is trying to communicate.  But I was saying that I think you're underestimating the people you were talking about. Everybody realizes they don't matter, and everybody has been realizing that for quite a while now. Usually pretty early in their lives. Why would that universal feeling suddenly spawn a 15,000 person protest? There would have had to be more to it than that. Like government corruption and systemic inequality and unethical financial practices and the factors you can easily read about if you so much as look at the wikipedia page.  At least, I think that's what you mean by \"the 99% was people realising they do not matter.\" You mean the feeling of being powerless as an individual, right? Probably mixed with some un-earned entitlement? Not the knowledge of being less powerful due to the inequality that exists in the US Democratic/Capitalist government/economic system and the conclusion that such a system is unjust?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > It is based on a fallacy that money = well being. It hasn't for the majority of time, why make a big deal about it now?  [That's really not true](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/yes-money-does-buy-happiness-6-lessons-from-the-newest-research-on-income-and-well-being/267016/). Money does equal well being up to a point. There is diminishing returns on happiness to money though, but just makes for a stronger argument against a rapidly increasing income for the 1% since it won't increase their well being nearly as much as it would for people with lower income. And again, it's about equity. The idea that someone should be valued for the work they contribute. In theory, with an equitable society, as the economy gets stronger, everyone should benefit, and yet we only see increases in those with the highest income. We *should* live in an equitable society. The whole point of a democratic society is to be as fair to as many people as is possible, and in this regard, the system has utterly failed a huge swath of people. I'd say they have every right to be angry about that.  > You were falling into territory that wasn't going anywhere with superlative language.  I feel pointing out your view is coming more from arrogance than logic is going somewhere pretty important, actually.  > Sure. Facebook, Go on there. Add people who post a lot of their own status's. Wait.  K, so you're just basing it on what \"feels\" right to you then, got it.  > 'The 1%' and 'they' are referring to different groups .  Yes, \"they\" is referring to the 99% movement. How is that twisting your words?  > if the 1% is over valued, then isn't they (the 99%) under valued?  The two are certainly related, but the difference of phrasing is significant. As I said, most people are ok with a wealth gap, and focusing on the undervalue adds an implication that that isn't the case, that everyone should be equal (as you said), while focusing on the overvalue is pointing out that there's no good reason for that gap to exist, and that this isn't equitable.  > Not really interested in your observer bias.  Right, but *your* observer bias is totally ok and using your facebook friends as a basis for 15 thousand people is totally fine.  > Never said they were better, but the wealthy do tend to have more say.  Say in what exactly? Politics? Society?  > I'm not saying they don't matter. I'm saying they thought it of themselves as a group, and were acting out from that belief as a group.  And I'm saying it wasn't about how much they did or didn't matter, it was about the unfairness of the stupidly large wealth gap. It was the fact that in our supposedly \"all men were created equal\" society, some men born into better circumstances would result in such a dramatic and unfair situation. The point was that according to the values of this country, what is happening should not be happening. It has nothing to do with the self-worth of the 15 thousand protesters.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That wasn't what he said and is completely unrelated to the truth.   You can easily look up \"Occupy Wall Street\" on wikipedia, which would have saved you time. [This is the link.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement).  The protest began with some university students who were dealing with massive budget cuts in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008, despite them having paid a good deal for the hope of a good future. I don't know how old you are and I don't know how you missed through 2008 (I was a kid during 2008 and the news never escaped me), but things were quite *tense* at the time.   The average wealth of the mean statistical person dropped by over 30%, and a great deal of suddenly poor people were looking for people to blame. The average wealth of the former top 1% in overall wealth had only dropped 11%, meaning that the rich were for the most part minorly inconvenienced while there were many suicides in the general population relating to bankruptcy.   In this sort of situation, people thought it would be a good idea to imitate the college protests and squat on various locations. The Spanish occupied various targets (the Great Recession affected the entire world), and some weeks/months later the Americans decided to fall suit and occupy wall street. A lot of people were unemployed so it wasn't as though they had anything better to do, which is why the whole trend accelerated the way it did.\n",

Being able to empathize with others and sacrifice your time, efforts, or safety in order to preserve theirs is inherent to the human condition. Leaving behind that self-centeredness and recognizing that self-preservation is not the ultimate goal is one of the marks of maturity in modern society.  An internet forum isn't going to convince you to be empathetic through reasoned argument, it is something you glean from life experience and time.  >i dunno, if it happened to your friend i think you'd be more angry than sympathetic, you'd think they were selfish. i kinda view it like that, it's weird  If I had a friend that made the choice to do something like this I would be proud of them, and try to help them be as safe as possible in their pursuit.\n",

That's selfish of you, because you are putting your interest (not wanting to get hurt by somebody else's actions) over the interest of your friend or relative, who presumably is doing this out of their own volition, and over the interest of many other people, who presumably want to get cured of ebola, saved from fires, etc. It's kind of how people get angry at somebody who died, as part of the grieving process: you feel like the person abandoned you to deal with all these unpleasant feelings and events. It comes from a feeling of powerlessness. Eventually healthy people accept that the world doesn't revolve around their wishes, they don't have control over everything that happens, and learn to live in an atmosphere of constant unwarranted change.\n",

If you could take today's society and replace it with one with greater technological superiority, but where on the whole people were less happy and there was more war/murder/etc. do you really think this would be the right thing to do? And if so then why? I certainly don't.  A society with superior technology but more suffering? [I don't beleive it is possible](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904106704576583203589408180). Happiness, to me, equates to fulfillment, which further extends to what you can achieve. Technology substantially increases what we are able to achieve. In my mind, I equate societies with more technology as more capable, and therefore more happy.  >I think this is one such misplaced sense of meaning. It's like a religious people saying to a nonreligious person \"I actually did something meaningful with my life\" because they followed God or whatever. Any sense of meaning related to building wonders is constructed by us. Which is fine, but it's not the only one. If we were all happy and lived fulfilling lives in peace etc. then I wouldn't use the fact that we could/couldn't build wonders as a sign of our success.   Again, I disagree. If someone happy does nothing, they are forgotten after their death. If someone unhappy builds a monument, that monument exists past their death. In that, their influence extends beyond death. This makes the creator more capable than the other, and thus better. Ideally the creator would also live a happy life as well as build the monument.  >(1) Why advances in science are the measure of a societies worth?   The more technology a society has, the more capable they become. It can boil down quite simply to empirical data. A more capable society is better than one who is less capable.   >(2) This somehow gives a society justification for harming others in order to achieve that goal?   In the end, yes. As predators consume prey to thrive, a superior society can consume a lesser one to advance. It is the nature, and reality of the world, and I place value on that.  \n",

Say both people do this. Yes, both have kids, but only the creator's kids can be influenced by the long standing monument. The other's children are influenced by it as well.

There are plenty of compelling reasons 18 years should be the age of financial adulthood, including: the ability to receive a credit card and rack up massive debt, the ability to join the armed forces, and the ability to pack up and straight-off leave the USA to not deal with it at all. Just because social trends, a greater emphasis on attending a 4-year than ever, and a poor job market have resulted in a higher percentage of young people living with their parents for a while doesn't necessarily mean we should radically shift the legal system around this, much less force this legally-binding assumption upon all young people and deny them comparable finances unless they find a way to break out of \"traditional\" status.  Know what's silly? The fact that a Veteran with a contract that has 1 day of Active Duty outside of training purposes is considered independent the day they finish training, but a Veteran that finishes the same training and heads home the day after finishing training and goes to a Reserve/Guard unit is considered a dependent. ONLY by the Department of Education for the purpose of the FAFSA amongst ALL government agencies does this definition apply.  21-year-old Guardsmen/Reservists that are without spouse/child (like I was) have the double-whammy of being subjected to labels of independence and dependence simultaneously within this system, and being impossible to get the tax returns of my deadbeat parents to complete my FAFSA, it was sheer luck that I was getting married that year so I could be independent (thankfully I have a wonderful wife two years older than myself that also wanted to marry young). This may sound like an obscure situation, but it's not. Turns out there are a lot of college-aged people in the Guard/Reserves.  So we deal with the hands-tied aspect of supposed semi-ignorance and dependence on our parents while also having the \"deal with it/figure it out\" side that a responsible adult should have. As it turns out, not every adult has responsible parents, and it's unfair to assume that a responsible student has responsible parents. Responsible people have the documentation required to file a FAFSA. My parents weren't, and even then it's not fair to assume that every parent wants to throw around their tax return to a kid that left the house when they graduated high school and wanted to live life as an independent adult.  It's not fair to adults to force them to feign and legally agree with dependence upon their parents because of the way the system currently works, despite the fact that some people truly are dependents, because so many others of us are 100% independent and can't receive so much as a tax return from our parents to fill out our aid forms. The system lacks flexibility and it's a well-known shortfall at this point that is entirely in-line with OPs rhetoric.  A line needs to be drawn somewhere, and the age of voting or being able to leave the country or, you know, GO TO COLLEGE ought to be the age where people are able to be considered independent enough to be treated as somebody, you know, over the age of majority that, you know, is going to college.

      "\t\t>>\t In the end, both kids are facing the same end situation: the costs of college without any parental support.  Their access to financial aid through FAFSA will depend purely on something they have no individual control over, even if it has no effect on their current financial status.  Sure, some *may* have been spoiled in the past, but FAFSA does not deny aid to someone whose parents were filthy rich until they were 15 before suddenly losing most of their money in a market crash or business failure.  FAFSA does not take into account historical parental assets or earnings, so why should it take into account historical parental contributions?\n",

The government doesn't know if their parents are still supporting them other than the kids word.   Why does it make sense that a 23 year old supporting themself since they were 18, file independently on taxes since they were 18, not allowed to file independently for financial aid. Because it could be abused? We let people abuse other welfare programs because of how few the numbers are and because it's better make sure all who need help get it than leave some who need help to starve solely to prevent a few leeches. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I know at the state level in my state they considered me an independent, but I had to jump through hoops to prove it. Basically I had to show I had been living on my own with no trips home longer than a week and that my parents hadn't given me more than $700 in the past year. Also I had to show I had a job and made enough to support myself and my parents weren't claiming me as a dependent. The dependent thing is crucial and most families would save more on taxes than the kid would get in financial aid, so I don't think many people would be willing to do that.   I think a lot of kids were in similar situations as I was. My parents had just lost everything right as I was graduating high school and although they still had a high income, they were in the process of filing for bankruptcy.

I realize you are arguing that they *should* be, but it is not a shift to consider 20-year-old students dependent on their parents.  Realistically, to fund an education, 20-year-olds are going to be dependent on someone--either their parents or the government.  I have no objection to increasing government funding for higher education, but if that is what you want, you need to convince the public that it is worth paying for.  A huge reason tuition at public universities is going up is [that states are cutting funding for higher education](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324549004579068992834736138).

      "\t\t>>\t And when that \"market crash\" happens while the student is in school, good fucking luck. That's exactly what happened to me and I was helpless. My parents were making about $160k iirc leading up to 2008 economic fuckery. My dad was laid off that September, called me and said \"I'm sorry, we can't pay for school anymore for you, but we already made 1/3 tuition payment a couple weeks ago so you have a little time. You'll need to get loans or pay yourself.\" At 18 years old I freaked the fuck out for a couple days and seriously considered dropping out, but my now-husband encouraged me to try to find a way to pay for school first.  Financial aid office told me to contact FAFSA about it, but FAFSA said I wasn't eligible for anything based on my parents income and because I was not independent and to wait and see what happened when I filed next year. Not even subsidized loans! February 2009 my mom was laid off from her job and my dad was still out of work, surely that would be good enough for FAFSA to give me some aid. Nope! Because of my dad's severance package, and the next year my mom's severance package, FAFSA still said they made too much for me to qualify for anything. They said that every fucking year. I tried every possible avenue they offered to appeal it and have an exception made.  For fucks sake, my 2008 tax return I started claiming myself because I was legit covering half or more of my expenses for the year. If the IRS is cool with me being financially independent, why not FAFSA too? Are they not part of the same government?  Meanwhile, my parents drained their savings to take care of their other two dependents while I was 100% on my own. I think they even borrowed from their 401k to make sure the mortgage and bills were always paid. They did the math and eating $1 Whoppers on Wednesdays was cheaper than making their own burgers and buying vegetables. My dad couldn't find a job for over a year despite plenty of experience and a masters degree in his field. My mom is still, almost 6 years later, unable to find work in her field. FAFSA was unwilling to see the reality of the situation and help me out. They counted severance AND unemployment compensation toward my parents' income when calculating their expected family contribution. They were barely getting by! But somehow still made too much. Essentially, FAFSA said they weren't poor enough. To make matters worse... I appealed to my university for their in-house financial aid and they said the same thing, my parents make too much. Went to the state asking for help and they said the same.  I ended up taking unsubsidized FAFSA loans, and found a state scholarship for STEM degrees that I got, which covered 1/2 my tuition. (Fun fact: that scholarship turned into a loan the day I stopped working in the state, so I'm now paying that back too.) I paid for the other 1/2 of my tuition out of pocket working 20-30 hours per week. And my room/food/books were thankfully paid for by working as an RA. So while I absolutely recognize that I am lucky my loans aren't ridiculous now that I'm done, it's still more than it could have and should have been. I can't even imagine students taking on double the debt I did just so they can sleep somewhere and eat every day. Or triple the debt so they can focus on school and not work so much. All because of financial factors that are completely out of their control. All because their family is not poor enough. \n",

The same families that work the system so that they have to pay only capital gain taxes rather than income tax will work the system so that the state supports their child going to school.   The entire system of financial aid that we do have is based on a certain about of parents providing financial support for their kids. Financial aid is a finite amount. The bean counters have to count on the fact that some money will come from the and that money will be supported by money that comes from parents. If you create a way that people can game the system, and they will, then that can throw the balance out of whack.   And at that point it would just be best to raise taxes and give people free school. Then again in America that would probably be seen as the socialists taking over to force students into liberal indoctrination camps, so that idea won't be happening any time soon. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t If the system requires a perfect leader in charge for it to work then it is not a good system to support. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Simply because of time right now, I will provide retort that in addition to slashing direct funding of universities by the states, the Higher Education Act of 1973 guaranteeing student loans for all to cover their whole education meant that universities could inflate tuition to whatever rate they wanted and students could pony it up.   At this point in time, many young Americans will go to college, and if America can give Wall Street a bailout to the tune of 700 billion dollars, if it can afford to service the loans, it can afford to shift that money to the universities instead, and there are now two generations of Americans that have been burdened under the system established in 1973.   Once Gen X/Millenials start to run Congress, I think we'll see more reformation-minded rhetoric reflected. The current Baby Boomers had the benefit of the old systems and took it for granted, and decided to slash it when they got in control because they no longer benefited from it but rather paid into it in the form of taxation.  The difference between 50 years ago and now in the University of Wisconsin system (my own) is that universities would get ~50% of their money from the government then directly, ~50% other sources. Now the amount received directly from government is ~21%. So despite the government being unable to pay the university directly, they pay the student so the university dictates the price. It sounds backwards because it is, particularly when you consider that the government loans are coming from taxpayer dollars that the student and their family pay into.   It's as if the government decided that instead of giving you something with your money, they decided to loan your money to you with interest while another entity funded with your money (both tax dollars and now loans) names the amount with no reason except how high they can go. The government can give us our money back in the form of a loan (which is paid for by our tax dollars), but will not do so in the form of directly funding the university, despite the fact that now student loan debt is a hindrance to the economy. Certainly there's the federal vs. state government providing the funding, but there's no reason the federal government couldn't provide the funding gap.  America has no excuse at this point with the amount of money we have. It's a shame and an embarrassment that because of our choice to allow education costs to spiral out of control that we have so much student loan debt. Great nations don't look at the cost of things as important as education, they look at the cost and the benefit. America was this way once, going to the Moon in a decade. We had things to be proud of and we knew that the benefit outweighed the cost. Things like the Space Race would be unthinkable now because of budgetary constraints created by political rhetoric.  The reason universities are so expensive at this point is because of that slashing and because now they can name their price and people pay. If the government dictated the terms and covered the entirety (making student attendance a non-factor in the university's ability to fund itself), we'd remove the two-fold reason the price inflated (this inflated price is of course what led to the massive debt).  The FAFSA is the only government form that assumes 18-year-olds are dependents still. Few families truly pay any sizable sum in practice as it is, and of course private universities would be unaffected as they do their own thing and the attendants are from families that generally choose to pay the premium for the education offered. Aside from this, covering the full cost at public universities will mean higher application rates as well as no need for the university to excessively market ($5 million dollar football/basketball coaches) as they don't profit more per-head as they did before, forcing them to be more competitive academically to get the brightest kids, as well as raising the bar for entry as now many individuals with intelligence but unwilling to go due to the price point have been given a ticket.  Education should not be seen as a \"service\", it should be seen as an investment crucial to national economic and strategic interests. Pissing all over our would-be entrepreneurs with a mountain of debt, disengaging many people that could contribute to society with more value... We have no excuse at this point. The price of public university attendance should not matter what the family situation of a student is, dependent or independent (as it should not exist except marginally) as it is government-run and serviced by tax dollars (directly through subsidy and indirectly through loans paid with tax dollars).  My point is that students' status should not matter at all. I don't pay a premium to use a public road or a public park that are funded with tax dollars. It would be absurd if I had to take a massive loan paid with tax dollars to cover a certificate allowing me to drive on a road paid for with tax dollars. Yet this is what we do to our young people that are trying to become greater contributors to society. The problem in this conversation is that while most people are talking about how to cover the increasing cost of tuition, the correct question in my opinion is asking how we get rid of the cost in the first place in a system that lends our tax money back to us with interest to pay for an institution we already pay for with taxes. If the university's education is worth it, we will get that money back in the form of higher income tax as those individuals make more, as well as the societal dividends of a more educated populace and the greater tech and management we receive. If a university's education is not worth it, we can shut it down and make education more competitive. Attendance should not be based on ability to pay, it should be based on ultimate ability to contribute to society.\n",

They have dramatically raised it recently, but that in particular isn't seen as something that affects universities academic independence.

Students from poorer families or who are independent of their parents get a larger loan (and have improved access to bursaries), but even those whose parents earn quite a lot can get something. I don't think this is an ideal system (I'd much prefer to return to the previous system where higher education was free and the government gave students grants to live) but, in my opinion, it works better than the US system for many students.\n",

Sandy Baum of the Urban Institute says that drop has been the single biggest reason for the increase in college costs.  > \"So it's not that colleges are spending more money to educate students,\" Baum says. \"It's that they have to get that money from someplace to replace their lost state funding — and that's from tuition and fees from students and families.\"  It is also worth realizing that as long as there is demand for expensive education, colleges will have high tuition.

Critics of higher education often blame faculty salaries for rising costs. However, when measured in constant dollars, salaries for full-time faculty at public institutions have actually declined. What is driving costs is the metastasizing army of administrators with bloated salaries, and our university presidents who are now paid as though they were CEOs running a business—and not a very successful one at that.  > There is also the growth in entertainment spending and spending on amenities.

      "\t\t>>\t First of all, the \"people in that very specific situation\" (presuming you mean my \"market crash\" group) *do* benefit now, that's the point: I was trying to show is that because FAFSA doesn't take into account historical earnings/assets, the historical support accorded to a \"spoiled\" kid whose parents won't pay for college can't be factored in.  Second, how would OP's solution substantially disadvantage lower-class kids?  What OP is suggesting is adding a workaround allowing students whose parents are not providing them any financial support to declare themselves as independents.  This workaround doesn't have to be *easy*, and you can force them to prove the lack of support.  This means detailed financial information, obviously, but it also means no living with the family over the summer, no major gifts (e.g. a shiny new BMW), no trips with family without personal receipts, and the option to remove FAFSA funding (plus potential fraud charges or similar) if evidence comes up showing the person has taken any significant support from a family member.  This can even be tied to student loans, allowing it to (at least to some extent) persist after graduation.  Unless the effects of such a change were enough to destabilize the entire FAFSA system, it shouldn't have much effect at all on how much lower-class kids would benefit, and the smaller we assume the group of unsupported kids with wealthy parents to be the smaller that effect gets.  (If there are a very small number of them extending help won't affect what's available to others; if there are a very large number of them they're a significant enough group that some level of change is justifiable to incorporate them.)  To some degree, yes, any such system can be gamed.  However, there's a pretty clear limit, and the costs of doing so aren't insignificant.  FAFSA funding is incredibly important for those who need it, but in comparison to what a \"rich\" family can provide it's a relatively small amount.  Sure, a rich family could withdraw support in order to \"score\" FAFSA funding for their kid (on someone else's dime), but in doing so they'd be guaranteeing that FAFSA funding was the *only* assistance their kid was getting.  My guess is that most rich families who are already willing to throw money at their kids won't be willing to cut them off entirely over the amount of money FAFSA offers, especially with the amount of effort involved.  Is all of this more work for FAFSA?  Sure, but as you've mentioned it would probably only be necessary for a relatively limited number of cases.  Basically, I'm not seeing a reason why FAFSA wouldn't be able to add some sort of exemption process for students receiving no familial support without compromising support for lower-class students.  Sure, it might not be easy, but in a country the size of the U.S. the number of people who would benefit is far from insignificant.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t I read your whole reply, but I'm just going to comment on a couple points.  You seem to be implying that colleges *want* to raise tuition.  They don't. With very few exceptions they aren't making more money. They raise tuition because in order to compete for students they need to spend more money.  The larger problem with your argument is that colleges are subsidized by taxpayers who paid for their own college and don't have kids.  I think we agree that that is a good thing, but it means you can't accurately say that you are giving yourself a loan. You are getting a loan from people who have already paid for their education.  If college becomes free for everyone then there will be drastically more pressure from taxpayers without kids to cut back on college services and to limit studies to areas that will be of immediate economic benefit to the public.  That isn't what is best for students.  > I don't pay a premium to use a public road or a public park that are funded with tax dollars.  There are many public roads and parks that have usage fees. In most aspects of public life we try to balance charging the general public and charging the specific people who use the public service.  Some transportation funding comes from general taxes some comes from gas taxes or car registrations.  We generally try to make these services accessible to everyone, but cost a bit more for those who benefit the most from them.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Yes, they definitely made more than the median household income. But I'm honestly not sure there was much wiggle room even after the lifestyle changes they made. Sure they weren't going out for drinks with friends anymore. But they still had a mortgage to pay, two dependents at home to support, etc. Cost of living is not cheap in their area (philly suburbs). There were probably expenses they could have cut back on more but I can't say for sure as I was distracted with getting my own finances in order. And the two dependents didn't know about the job losses for a while, so maybe they were keeping up appearances so the dependents' day to day wasn't disrupted. I think at first with severance and savings they gambled on finding jobs quickly while being more frugal than usual and not contributing to savings anymore, but the job market was rougher than anticipated. So while the FAFSA calculation may be consistently applied to all applicants, it does not take into account cost of living variations (but that's a whole other issue). At $100k gross income, regardless of income source, FAFSA was saying they should be contributing over $40k for the year. That itself is pretty crazy when you factor in cost of living.   Anyway. I shared my experience to highlight an example of when the FAFSA dependency status is bullshit. Quite simply, if the IRS says you're independent then so should FAFSA. \n",

      "\t\t>>\t You're not really addressing the one and only reason that financial aid is based on parents' ability to pay regardless of their willingness to pay:   There is absolutely no incentive to pay for college as a wealthy parent if your child merely has to state their financial independence. Until YOU can prove that this wouldn't be a problem in the current system, you're essentially just complaining about how life isn't fair.   The problem is that parents very rarely decide they will not fund their students education, but their children still go to expensive private colleges or out of state universities (as opposed to seeking scholarships or less expensive in state universities). Parents decide to not pay for a lot of things for their kids. The difference between poor and rich parents, though, is that not only will the rich kid have more opportunity throughout their life completely apart from how much their parents fund college, they're also going to inherit a lot more than the poor children. There can be better systems, but if you would like to disregard them in this discussion, YOU need to state how funding for actually needy families would not be split and massively reduced in order to give the money to everyone.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t sorry, on my phone it looked like i responded to the wrong comment so i deleted it :/ I'll try to find what I actually said  edit: I GOT IT!!  >Yeah, I completely agree that it's not gonna be fair 100% percent of the time. But nothing's gonna be fair 100% of the time. We just need to do the best we can with the information we can and, on average, I would bet way more lower class kids would benefit from getting a leg up getting into college than middle/upper class kids would. I mean, if you're applying to college right out of high school, the entirety of your life has been determined by your parents for the last 18 years. Those are some pretty god damn important periods of your life; having a wealthy family that can provide you with all your necessities and then some makes a HUGE difference. Are there rich parents who neglect their kids during this time? Sure. But there's got to be WAY more kids on the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum that are negatively affected and so will have a harder time with ANYTHING they want to do straight out of high school than those on the middle/high end. Once again, definitely an imperfect system. But we still need to consider what the most good we can do is, where we can do it the most.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > sure they pay for phone and car insurance and a place to sleep, but that's not much considering it's you know, their fucking child.  I pay for all those things myself. I live in a cheap area, so rent + utilities is about $350. Phone and car insurance are a little over $100 a month. That's right around the $5500 a year that a Pell Grant gives you. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Tuition at public schools is rising mostly because State Governments have cut funding for higher education.  I think you are drastically overestimating the percent of tuition that is paid for by federal aid.  If you want a truly \"fair\" system from the perspective of students then the government should pay for the cost of higher education--but that's incredibly unfair to the taxpayers who paid for their own education and don't have kids.  I think you should abandon your abstract idea of fair and start thinking more about the actual implications of the ideas you are proposing. If we adopted your proposal, nearly every wealthy family would cut off financial support for their kids at age 18. That would mean the government would be spending more on tuition and would end up spending more on food stamps and other assistance for teenagers who could easily be cared for by their parents. So who should pay for those teenagers?  I don't have any problem with increasing financial aid for students, but we shouldn't pretend that the money comes from nowhere.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t It's not that some people might abuse it. The objection is that if it's possible, almost every single family will use it. That means the family contribution will almost always be zero. So financial aid will be the same for all students, which is just another way of saying it won't exist.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I'll also only respond to a few too, but I'd like to remark that many of my beliefs are flexible and it's been enjoyable reading many of your points. With some of my points I play Devil's Advocate just to pursue and assess multiple sides even if I don't believe the rhetoric entirely myself.   While Driver's Licenses/License plates are fees, they are nothing close to the direct cost of the road, much less requiring massive loans. Yet the cost-per-foot of the roads are quite high. Public use and benefit for them go to all, as well as the cost. But you can also say that it's no more than the community impact of educated individuals creating new businesses, industries, and products that better the world.  Additionally, our point is the same about universities on money and their spending to attract students. Their highly-paid coaches and large stadiums are an example of their marketing department (people want to see Gator Football, for an example), and they want them to be the best to attract more students so they get more money to get better coaches, etc. I'm not saying that they do it so some Administrator makes a higher profit, though it definitely could have sounded that way. So there's clarity. :)  I should add that there's a second-factor to my rhetoric; I don't believe that we need so many people going to school, and it's been pushed much more heavily in recent decades. While I believe many people that would do great in school avoid it due to the debt burden, there are many people who simply go to college that will contribute to society with careers that don't actually need a degree. Some don't even want to go but feel they should. The government-dictated funding would provide a harder cap on how many students are allowed enrollment, pushing the standards for entry upward, meaning that a greater percentage of the students enrolled are likely those that would receive greater benefit.  Many industrialized nations offer education heavily subsidized or free compared to us. The common argument is that we're a bigger country and couldn't afford it. My reply is that because we're a bigger country we should be able to afford it more easily because we allow greater specialization in our nation with more people and a more diverse economy.  Keep in mind that US Student Loan Debt as of June 2014 was 1.2 trillion. The Stimulus of 2008 (TARP) and the Bailout of 2008 (Emergency Economic Stabilization Act) were both around 700 billion dollars. For that cost we could have entirely wiped out all existing debt that covers many years' tuition and expenses at universities. The cost for 1 year of expenses at a university, if we budgeted, is laughable, especially considering that we'd drive the cost down if universities no longer had to market so aggressively and would thereby need less money to operate. \n",

      "\t\t>>\t I'm fairly certain that \"public university\" implies that the institution is A: not for profit (to contrast it with a private institution such as Full Sail or DeVry) and B: subject to state and federal education regulations as a public university such as rules against discrimination, accepting grant/loan money from students, or filing very specific paper work. In return for being public (and meeting certain standards) the university is eligible to get government grant money or allow its degrees to be considered equivalent with other universities which offer equivalent degrees.   It's not public in the same way that a park is public or a library is public, nor is it private in the way that a business is private or a residence is private. It's not really the property of the state or run by the government; it's run according to its own officials and policies in so far as the existing rules it agrees to follow allow it to flexibly make those decisions on its own (such as who to hire or what they will charge for tuition).  Using the word \"public\" in front of universities isn't meant to imply the same relationship as when its used for the \"public broadcasting service\" or even in the same way that the Postal Service is public. It's meant to contrast with the idea of a private university - which would be one that isn't regulated by the government. They purport to teach, declare that criteria for degrees have been met, and charge for their services and their students hope that when they leave, someone thinks what they learned was valuable. Since the quality of the education wasn't held to national standards, there's not a lot of confidence that a private college inspires for some people. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I don't think \"ownership\" is the right word either. At least in California, the UC system receives (some) funding from the government but is controlled by the Board of Regents, which are appointed by the governor. However that doesn't mean they are directly under his control at all; recently they raised tuition against his will.   Also, the universities are not directly tied to the federal government, which would make it impossible for the aid to come in the form of just waiving tuition fees.  The end result of this aid, and unfortunately the fundamental problem with the entire system in the United States, is that all universities (especially private ones) will use it to simply raise tuition prices.\n",

(Other states have regents, boards of governors, etc.) The state indirectly administers the school through its appointees, and the legislature has some say in school governance, including tuition. Meanwhile, a school like BU only receives grants, usually for specific items, and is funded by an endowment that derives much of its money from alumni donations (please note, I'm oversimplifying here). It is run by privately elected trustees and a president chosen by the trustees.

Scrabble works because the tiles are pretty well balanced (maybe s needs to be worth nothing on its own, its a really great tile). The harder to use letters are worth more points, so if you get high point or low point letters, you can win both ways. But in smash, many of the items don't feel balanced like this.

Jobs and job qualifications, however, ARE the goals of technical schools, where, if I'm not wrong, the load is lightened in terms of breadth. Not sure if the bar is raised, but that's something you'll have to take up with technical schools if they're not. \n",

If so, doesn't accomplishing the goal mean the money was not wasted?  Yes, it might be true that society MIGHT (and I say might because I'm not sure about the figures on it, and I think there's a chance that the current system might break even) not be seeing a MONETARY return on investment.

      "\t\t>>\t > Drugs  This part is interesting because of the description of the complex nature of the situation. In the case of crimes resulting from drugs, I mentioned below that I believe the crime itself should be the primary offence, and the drug use which facilitated it would be a secondary offence that get tagged onto crimes. This would punish those who go crazy from drugs, without inherently punishing anyone for possession or use who has otherwise done nothing wrong. As to the rest, I understand the nature of the complex situation, but I'm not convinced that most people really think of it logically to that extent, nor that it is a problem helped by pushing it into the dark and more obscure recesses of society. Imagine momentarily a society where these kinds of drugs were legal and regulated the same way as a prescription or over the counter medication. Safe pre-made doses, regulated by bodies who can test that companies are making them to be as clean as possible, not something people have to do secretively in a dark alley trying to make sure they don't get caught. I think part of the open use would be a more constructive conversation about the potential for abuse, and a reduction in drug related crimes and deaths. When we had high school drug intervention speeches, the officers came in with posters of dead kids and stories... almost all of them ended with \"his friend saw him passed out, got scared about someone finding out, and ran away leaving him to die without medical attention\". If there wasn't the fear of punishment for using the drugs, I think a lot of these lives senselessly lost could have been saved. Beyond that... I can see what you're saying about the issues with family and state, and the complex situations that could arise... but I think the current stigma of \"just trying to get high is wrong\" marginalizes and generalized a much more complex issue without leaving open a discussion for the complexity that surrounds it.   > Incest  The big point you made was about children with parents, and about family matters. As for births, recessive genes isn't a great argument since we don't live in a eugenic society. People have disabled kids all the time, no one is legally stopping them. As for children with parents, I made the point below that it should be a discussion of people of consenting age... not that some mother was manipulating their 6 year old to pleasure them. Paedophilia is a separate debate, and something of a grey area beyond about age 14 or 15, but of course the power struggle is a concern, and I recognize that point. My argument was for 2 people above the legal age, however. As for a family dispute as a result... I think this is an issue even in normal relationships. Mother's getting attached to girlfriends and trying to get them married, the fallout afterwards... same goes for friendship circles when 2 friends date. This is an issue of openness, discussion, and the maturity of the social group. If 2 people date and then break up and it causes some kind of dilemma, that's an issue with the people not inherently the act itself. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I can tell you 100% that all drugs should be legalized immediately, everything. The science on this is rock solid and beyond question. Particularly in the case of hard drugs abuse, these people always, always have some sort of history of extreme abuse or neglect in their lives. Their brains become wired specifically toward their drug of choice, opiates, amphetamines or both. A huge part of what keeps them down is the feeling of being social outcasts - feeling unable to integrate back into society, it's easier to turn back to addiction. In situations where they are treated with dignity, given access to health services. Even giving them access to free, clean drugs ends the cycle faster and more cheaply because they aren't exposing themselves to nearly as many risks like sexual abusing themselves, criminal behavior and the risk of OD. Experiments have been done and these things have been a resounding success.  What's really happening is that the state is actually preying on these people. The vast state apparatus is proof of this, police, legal system, prisons. The corruption surrounding these entities is enormously powerful. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Actually, let's just take heroin for an example of a \"dangerous\" addictive drug. Is it really the drug that is causing the problem, or is it the person's behaviour? It's clearly the latter, since the drug is just a powder extracted from a plant, it's not inherently problematic. It's *connected* to problems, but that's not to say it directly causes them. Is addiction the culprit? Not necessarily, as being addicted to something doesn't harm anyone but the addict, and only when the addict chooses to perform antisocial actions to feed their addiction. Addiction is not even a socially devastating event in any case; plenty of cigarette smokers attest to the prevalence of benign addiction in our society. If heroin were not illegal it would cost pennies to feed a habit, meaning an addict would not have to rob or steal. If the argument is then that the intoxication leads to antisocial activities keep in mind that, again, we have plenty of intoxicating activities in our society (alcohol is the big one) and the moral fabric has not degraded to a point where we have been ruined by it. We are adults and we can choose appropriate times and places for intoxication. We forbid intoxication when it can be societally dangerous (driving, operating machines) and morally abhor it when we feel it is inappropriate (around children, etc).  There is no rational reason for us to condone some drugs and forbid others, only moral habit, ingrained by culture. Some people in the world have a greater propensity for self-destruction than others, and these people often turn to drugs to escape life and hurt themselves. This is up to them, as they are adults and they can do as they choose. It is a moral evasion for society to blame drugs for the problem and not the user, as it allows us to blame an externality for our problems rather than human nature, which is tantamount to avoiding taking responsibility for our own actions.\n",

Imagine if we increased the number of people that it was available to a thousand-fold, including people who don't think through the consequences of addiction.  The can't be a good thing.  Societal disapproval is the only tool beyond laws to prevent behavior harmful to society - and can be more effective than laws.  >Incest  No, we don't stop people from having disabled children, but we don't want to encourage situations that increase the incidence either.  Because once again, society pays to help take care of the children.  As for age of consent, there will ALWAYS been a power disparity.

      "\t\t>>\t > We can look at our society, where opiates are tightly controlled, yet we regularly read about people who got put on oxycontin for pain, became addicted, and their life goes to hell.  Poor medical practices aren't a good example here. If a patient was given so many opiates they developed an addiction then that is a medical failing. If they've taken somebody else's medication and developed an addiction then, again, the real antisocial problems occur when they cannot get or afford their drugs anymore. Oxycontin sells for upwards of $30 a pill on the street, it's a crippling habit to afford. If they had their drugs cheaply available, or free, they would simply be an addict, not necessarily a destructive and antisocial addict.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I think you can have societal disapproval without stigma. Disapproval is finding out your friend is addicted to Oxy and forcing them into rehab. Stigma is finding out and disassociating from them because of it. Stigma makes it easy to demonize addicts as hopeless causes or less-than-people; I think society could be more open and honest about substance abuse without necessarily condoning it.  Also, not sure what OP was referring to, but some people when they talk about legalizing these drugs are referring to having them available by prescription as a treatment for addiction itself, for cases where abstinence or reduced use has not worked. Prescription drugs, in contrast, are a treatment for something else. Some people envision having even stricter legal controls than prescription drugs, eg having an injection facility where you can go for a controlled dose of heroin that never leaves the facility. There are many shades of legalization.\n",

Were he my \"type\" and not romantically involved with my mother (and further, were he gay) I see no reason why I would necessarily be in an \"unhealthy\" relationship with him just because he is my father.

      "\t\t>>\t The point is that deciding what drugs to ban is arbitrary. Alcohol is [carcinogenic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IARC_Group_1_carcinogens), habit forming, causes antisocial behaviour, and can cause lethal withdrawal. [By some measures *heroin is safer than alcohol.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse#mediaviewer/File:HarmCausedByDrugsTable.svg) Yet people aren't out in the streets demanding alcohol prohibition (anymore). Indeed, its prohibition was a complete disaster. So there is clearly a disconnect here if we are looking at prohibiting some drugs based purely on objective data.  The thing is, *plenty of things we do in life are dangerous.* And we don't prohibit them because we're grown adults and we can do what we want. Belief in personal freedom is a huge component of Western morality, yet we maintain drug prohibition when there is objective evidence that not only does it not work but also that it exacerbates the problems we have with illegal drugs rather than mitigating them.  I agree with the OP, the only reason people object (mostly) to hard drug use is cultural conditioning. There is no rational reason. Legalize it, make it cheap and safe, and stop ostracizing the poor and vulnerable subset of society that chooses to do these things to excess.  One edit:   > It's also a hell of a lot easier to become a drain on society with cheap and abundant heroin than without it.  Heroin is already abundant. It's just not cheap. Reducing its cost to pennies a dose (or even providing it free) would turn a huge portion of our underclass from poor, antisocial, self-destructive fringe dwellers into simply self-destructive fringe dwellers. If you still want to look down on them morally for their choices that's up to you.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > When particular drugs have very statistically reliable effects on moral habits, then we have rational reason to forbid them.  I somewhat agree with this, but keep in mind the drug does not directly *cause* antisocial effects. It simply intoxicates the user and they nod off in a chair. We may condemn this behaviour as a \"waste of their life\", but it's arguably similar to sitting and watching TV or playing video games for hours on end, other activities that some people (i.e.: my parents' generation) consider a \"waste of their life.\" The true antisocial behaviours come from the addict trying to get more drug without the means, leading to the neglect of the normal parts of their life (work, housecleaning, proper food, etc) and theft, begging, etc. It could be argued that, say, methamphetamine would be a better candidate for prohibition since the behaviour of the individual *while on the drug* is more dangerous. Then again, a heavily drunk person can be just as problematic.  I simply argue that drug prohibition is akin to abstinence-only sex education: naive and ineffective at best, and at worst actually causing more problems than it solves.  My edit for your edit: :)  > Alcohol is legal because sufficiently many people wanted it legal, whilst being able to participate in democracy, to overturn a prohibition law. Heroin is not legal because there are fewer people who want it, and they are further from democratic enfranchisement, compared to those who don't do heroin and don't want to pay for the resulting medical emergencies and chronic issues.  Spot on. But I believe the medical emergencies/chronic issues of addicts could be enormously reduced by treating addiction as a medical, rather than criminal problem. The prevalence of hard drugs in maximum-security prisons attests to the fact that we will *never* make them disappear, no matter how hard the police crack down, so the best we can do is harm reduction.  As an aside, we appear to have sidetracked into Ye Olde Druge Prohibition debate instead of the moral issue the OP was talking about.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t If you want to start your own society, go for it.  That's what I was talking about in my Montana reference - if you are literally off on your own, not interacting with others, feel free to grow and use whatever drugs you want.    But in the context of the current society, we've made decisions like \"if the parents aren't capable of providing adequate (as defined by society) care for their children, we, society, will step in and care for them at our own expense\".  In that case, your choices are no longer just impacting you.  As for your conscience?  If it doesn't bug you to cut in line, then it's ok to do so?  In general, even though it's best for you, personally, it's the disapproval of others (in a queuing culture) that keeps you from being a dick, even if you don't see it that way.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > The point is that deciding what drugs to ban is arbitrary.  Damn near everything we do in society is arbitrary. We arbitrarily decided that our choice of government would be a liberal democratic republic for example. We had other choices, but that is the one that won out. Now it did so for a host of historical contextual reasons, but it wasn't the only available choice nor was it in some way objectively best. It was just what was popular. That's the definition of arbitrary.   And if it wasn't for that arbitrary choice, then the option to even discuss what drugs we would like banned and which we would not want banned wouldn't be open to discussion. But the point is, just because something is an arbitrary decision doesn't mean it's a random decision or that it is a bad decision. It just means that other lines of reasoning would lead to other equally valid choices. Arbitrary is 'decided by one's liking, dependent upon will or pleasure; at the discretion or option of any one' (OED).  But simply because a choice is subjective (arbitrary) doesn't make it illogical.   Arbitrary choices can and are still logically supported.  At issue for reasonableness and logic in arbitrary choices is the question of if you shared the starting assumptions of those making the choice, would the choice made be a logically consistent outcome.   If the question is the OP's point about the reasonableness of moral injunctions, then the question of the arbitrariness of the choices made is really not addressing the question in any meaningful way.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I don't think you know what arbitrary means. Strawberries also have carcinogens in them but we don't ban them because they aren't as bad for you. Anyone who tries to deny the difference in effects between heroin and beer is deluding themselves.  Your high-and-mighty stance on garnteller looking down on the poor like a big bad upper-class jerk is also a giveaway you're soapboxing. I'm glad you know about the abundant evidence without citing it too, great job.  \n",

      "\t\t>>\t > I would be willing to wager that the 75% who never became addicted were only using once or twice in their entire life.  Na, I don't think so. That particular study didn't look into it but it does refer to other survey data which only included drug users who used heroin at least 6 times. They did this to exclude experimental users. This survey showed that:  \"an estimated 71.2 percent of the daily heroin users reported having felt dependent on heroin. By comparison, an estimated 8.9 percent of the never daily users reported having had feelings of dependence on heroin. This difference in percentages from about 9 to 71 percent is consistent with presumed toxicity of nondaily heroin use versus daily heroin use.\" [Source] (http://ww1.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/92.pdf)  Basically, the people who used heroin every day had a high likelihood of feeling dependent, yes. Everyone else who used heroin less-than-daily but on 6 or more occasions had a very low likelihood of feeling dependent - so that 75% from before isn't just one or two-time users. Yes it's self-reported and subjective but it's the best data I could find.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well you have a 50% chance of dying from a smoking-related illness if you smoke cigarettes, and lots of people (far more people than use heroin, cocaine, and meth combined) still use those. 25% is high but it still remains that you are far more likely (75% likely) to _not_ become an addict. Maybe what I'm taking issue with is more your phrasing, which sounded like, 'If you do heroin, you are likely to become a junkie.' That isn't true. It's cartoonish because you're taking the less likely outcome and making it sound like the most likely, and more than that focusing specifically on the worst case scenario of the non-functioing, stealing, OD-ing junkie within that less-likely outcome.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t >But if you're shooting heroin, there's a good chance you'll become hooked.  This is not how addiction works, we have good science to prove it.

This is propaganda 101. Society is being lead into these values by mouth pieces who make decisions for us.   We don't exist just be facsimiles. It's not how any of this is supposed to work. The social stigma you fear is an illusion. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t I'm making a rational argument here and you're accusing me of \"soapboxing?\" You're bringing *strawberries* into a debate about hard drugs here, I think you're derailing things a little.  Where did I claim \"abundant evidence\" without citing sources? You can look at [drug policy in Portugal](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal#Observations), which decriminalized *all* drugs in 2001, for evidence as to what the effects are of loosening drug laws. The Netherlands provides [heroin for free to addicts](https://news.vice.com/article/only-in-the-netherlands-do-addicts-complain-about-free-government-heroin) and it has had a massive public health benefit. Again, nothing is perfect, but we're not trying to make society perfect here, simply improve the lives of our citizens.  Frankly, I think your aggression is unwarranted, and you haven't contributed to the debate. I get the feeling I'm getting a bit of animosity here because I'm debating someone with \"81 deltas\".\n",
      "\t\t>>\t You're right about the alcohol, which is why we ban *drunk driving*, not drinking itself. Similarly we ban driving under *any* intoxicant or *any* intoxicated state. Being sleepy isn't illegal, but driving sleepy *is*. Getting drunk isn't, but beating your wife while drunk *is.* That's the distinction. I would argue people should not be driving or operating heavy machinery if they are impaired in any way at all, and I would suggest that being under the effects of *withdrawal* does not constitute proper sobriety.  Drugs may predispose towards certain behaviours (and they do), like sitting around while high on pot, fighting while drunk, or being a loud asshole while on cocaine, but, again, this is not reason enough to ban the drug. We expect people to behave appropriately in society and not break the \"big\" laws (i.e.: cause harm to others), and if they are unable to do so they should be encouraged to stop by their friends, family, or whatever. It is not the role of the state to prevent activities which \"predispose\" towards certain behaviours as there is no certainty that a crime will be committed. People being able to enjoy their lives should take precedence.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Yes, and that difference is consequences.  If you shoot up because you had a long day at work, pass out on your side, and wake up to do it again the next day, then you are probably not an addict.  If you lost your job because you were stoned, sold all your stuff for money, spent all your money on drugs, can't pay your bills, and still want to shoot up, you are addicted.  If you ever think, \"I want to quit but can't,\" you are an addict.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I mean that each time you do heroin, you get closer to getting addicted.    I suppose its possible to use heroin regularly (like alcohol) and not really be addicted, but given most statistics and nearly every heroin experience I have ever seen... It doesn't seem likely.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I am commenting about the numbers that vote squinty posted above. It says 1 in 4 become addicted. They are saying that isn't significant. I think most people would say that is significant.  EDIT: http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin  That was the original source that voted_quimby was quoting.  They are pointing to those numbers and saying that heroin is not very addictive because only 1 in 4 becomes addictive. My argument is that 1 in 4 is extremely addictive, especially when you take into consideration that this number is based on anyone who has ever tried heroin, *even once.*  From personal experience, it is definitely possible to only do heroin once, but if you go back to do it a second and third time, I feel your chances to get hooked grow exponentially higher.  Personally I have never met anyone who can just do heroin every once in a while like alcohol or cocaine.  In my personal experience, it is definitely a more habit forming drug and most of the statistics seem to back that up.  I didn't realize there was so much confusion about this.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Hey, I mean whatever.  I know people who have used heroin and not become hopelessly addicted.  Its definitely possible, but all these statistics seem to point to Heroin being really addictive, which is pretty much in line with everything I have seen from personal experience.  I feel like you are splitting hairs. Heroin is addictive and its really shitty for your body. Do people paint it to be cartoonishly and unjustly evil? I don't think so.  I would say the reason people paint it in such a bad light is because once you are addicted, its an extremely ugly and painful process to get off of it.  Of all the drugs, I'm not sure why you would even try to defend heroin. I personally have never heard a good heroin story or seen a statistic that made me think heroin was being unjustly vilified by popular opinion.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Everyone else seemed to understand that \"good chance\" meant a significant chance, not more likely than not.  If I could enter a lottery for $1 with a 1 in 100 chance of winning $1000, everyone would agree that I have a \"good chance\" of winning.  This is common usage.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Sorry, I haven't any idea what you're trying to say here.    Another user posted a link to a study about how 1 in 4 heroin users become addition.  How is it that you think it works?  >We don't exist just be facsimiles. It's not how any of this is supposed to work. The social stigma you fear is an illusion.  Um, ok.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I don't care about deltas, but there are many many chemicals which are carcinogenic and you seem to think that the fact that alcohol and heroin both having some makes them more or less the same. Toothpaste and many things you encounter throughout the day have carcinogens so their mere presence is irrelevant.   I understand what Portugal did, but the United States isn't Portugal, and assuming everything will be parallel is foolish.   My aggression is brought on by the use of words that have no place in your sentences and are used simply to mislead a given reader. Empty rhetoric used as some kind of placeholder for a compelling argument.  \"Plenty of things we do in life are dangerous. And we don't prohibit them because we're grown adults and we can do what we want,\" is exactly what I mean. This argument could be used to justify anything being legal so long as it had no absolutely direct harm to another human being, but we know that makes no sense, so we dismiss it as a reasonable argument.   Putting quotation marks around \"dangerous\" when referring to heroin is as callous as it is insulting. Have you ever met a heroin addict? Your writing makes it seem like it is as harmless as getting addicted to candycrush. Not to mention how you follow that up with a complete dissociation of cause and effect. \"Oh this person is doing hard drugs, well their actions are still there own and in no way affected by anything else! Yay, no causality!\"   An amalgamation of so many weird and illogical statements is not only unconvincing but just unpleasant to read.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t > all these statistics seem to point to Heroin being really addictive... Of all the drugs, I'm not sure why you would even try to defend heroin  Let's put it in the context of [other drugs](http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&page=95) then. 23% of heroin users become dependent, 32% of tobacco users, 15% of alcohol users, 18% of cocaine users... the rates are pretty similar, smoking tobacco has just as high a mortality rate and can directly kill the people around you, alcohol is worse for your bodily health and also contributes to tens of thousands of cases of accidental injury/death, rape, and domestic violence every year.... But by popular belief, _heroin_ is the worst of the lot, nothing else even comes close.  Maybe you think overstating the risk is ok because it deters people from using it, how could that be a bad thing? I think that can be very bad. I think there is value in people understanding the true breadth and magnitude of the problem, both so that they can make informed decisions for themselves and for others. I think it's bad that people are so afraid of heroin that they won't even consider policies that could be construed as 'soft'. Decriminalized use, prescription heroin for addicts, syringe exchanges in many states, those options (though they have been shown to be effective at reducing the harms of abuse) are completely off the table because people are so afraid of it. I don't think that is helpful to users or to society.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I don't know that most people did understand; I don't mean to attack or infer about you personally but in my experience both on Reddit and in real life (even with people who should know better, such as physicians), most people have a very exaggerated perception of heroin - thinking that it's addicting after the first time, or that 90% of people who use it die from it, or that heroin users are criminal junkies, or what have you. Your description implicitly reinforced those stereotypes, and I think that contributes to the harmful stigmas that are the subject of this thread.   Both times in the past that I have brought up the 25% figure on Reddit in the past, people have been very, very surprised and even disbelieving of it because it is so much lower than what they would have assumed. If we're going to talk about a subject that most people have misperceptions about, I think full objective disclosure and not playing into stereotypes is important.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t That study doesn't contradict anything I'm saying. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t > This argument could be used to justify anything being legal so long as it had no absolutely direct harm to another human being.  With the caveat of \"no direct or *indirect*\" harm to another human being, I actually have no problem with this statement at all. I believe you should be able to do absolutely anything you want in the world as long as you do not harm others. Is this really a bad statement?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Haha, okay, you got me, that's a good point. :) But still, we don't ban alcohol because of drunk driving! Similarly, I see no reason to ban other drugs because they also get you intoxicated, and especially considering the intoxication from some of them is benign.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t You are not reading that study correctly.  Or rather you are also ignoring the percentage of people who tried it in the first place.  Notice that only 2% of the people interviewed for that study tried Heroin... and 23% became addicted.  The low percentage of people interviewed who have actually tried heroin, makes the percentage more powerful.  From such a small sample group and a quarter of them became addicted?  That is huge.  Also it is ignoring that alcohol and tobacco are sold cheaply and legally and alcohol is basically a cultural norm at this point.  The majority of people interviewed in that study had tried alcohol or cigarettes. If heroin was as socially accepted as cigarettes and alcohol, the percentage would go up.  Also one thing we haven't covered yet is the withdrawal process.  Heroin and cigarettes may be comparable in terms of addictiveness, but Heroin is harder to kick. Opioid withdrawal causes chills, cramps, sweating, diarrhea, nausea, anxiety, etc.  Nicotine withdrawal causes anxiety, difficulty in concentration and constipation.  Withdrawing from Heroin is a complete nightmare.   It is worth noting that heroin on its own (in proper non lethal doses) carries very little health risks.  It causes constipation and possibly some kidney damage, even after long term use. Heroin is feared as the big scary monster of the drug world, because it so hard to get off once you are addicted.   I don't believe in overstating any risks.  The risk of heroin speaks for itself.  For the record, I think most drugs should be legal and ALL drugs decriminalized... But thats why its so important not to downplay the destructive nature of Heroin.  It shouldn't be illegal anymore than rat poison is illegal, but it should handled with about as much care. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t 1) There are a bevy of indirect harms in this case so the argument has no place.  2) Otherwise it could make sense, you can read JSM if you like, he is germane on that.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Ok, I accept your viewpoint, but you are actually reading the source wrong. The 2% number on the left is a portion of the total population and the number on the right is a percentage _of that 2%_. If the number of users went up from say 2% to 3% of the population, the _absolute number_ of heroin-dependent users would go up - 23% of a bigger number is obviously more than 23% of a smaller number - but the rate would stay the same at 23%. Only 2% trying it doesn't make the 23% 'more powerful.' If anything, it does the opposite...  > If heroin was as socially accepted as cigarettes and alcohol, the percentage would go up.  If the number of heroin users changed so drastically that it included a significant portion of the population, the rate of dependency might change somewhat - but we would expect it to go down, not up. The reason is this: heroin is currently socially unacceptable and a very uncommon drug. The 2% who are doing it now _despite those social stigmas_ are probably more risk-taking, impulsive, antisocial, less health-conscious, etc than the average person. People with these traits are more likely to become dependent, so they bring the dependency rate up. That rate of dependency is basically selecting for people who are more likely to become drug-dependent than the average person.  Conversely, almost everyone has used alcohol. So the population of alcohol users not only includes the same types of anti-social risk-takers that use heroin, but also people with average and above average risk-aversion and impulse control. These people are less likely to become dependent so they bring the overall dependency rate of alcohol down -they compensate for the high-risk people.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well, we could get all philosophical about this and say that *all* actions lead to harm by some convoluted trail of events, but we should really be reasonable and stick to direct or very close to direct events causing harm (e.g.: polluting a shared resource for personal gain, or something like that).

What are your thoughts on that, out of interest?  Well, let's get one thing straight: atheism is a lack of a belief in god(s) (an absence of 'theism') not an organisation, creed, code, community or dogma. It's not a system or a group of any kind - it's a label referring to people who do not hold a certain belief.   We all have moral obligations - not to kill, not to lie, not to steal - etc., but I don't believe anyone has a moral obligation to espouse their viewpoint if they do not wish to.   Think of how many causes we all have viewpoints on, one way or the other. I am a supporter of feminism, animal rights, civil rights. I oppose fascism, totalitarianism, and jingoistic nationalism. But many of these topics, for one reason or another, are not really my area of interest. I love philosophy, literature, critical thinking, psychology and art. I'm neither very naturally interested in political issues, nor very intelligent at learning about or discussing them. Whereas I would say that I sympathise with - for example - the feminist cause, I am aware of my own ignorance of this issue and I do not feel I have any moral obligation to go around debating it and proselytising it. The issues which I *do* feel like debating and proselytising are ones I am more interested in, more knowledgeable on, and better at discussing.   So, essentially, I don't think anyone has a moral obligation to be a vocal defender or attacker of one position or another, simply because there are too many issues out there. People should focus on what interests them and not be forced to debate things they are aware they have little knowledge of or interest in.\n",

No matter if you get hung up on ethics vs morals. It comes from society. And it is a feedback loop.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Honestly, it has never entered my head a single time while saying something is \"gay\" that it had anything to do with homosexuality *at the point of saying it*. I'm 24 and have used that term since childhood to display mild annoyance at something. Since my teens, and with a larger use of the internet, I have used the word \"faggot\" to express a stronger disdain for something or a joke towards someone I felt was acting like an idiot. Both of these words have become so far removed from their original meaning in my mind (and I'm willing to bet for other people) that they only retain the meaning of \"something that is bad\". While, yes, you could attach the \"something that is bad\" to homosexuals via mental connotation but the reality is that it's only ever when the subject OP has raised comes up that I ever think about it in those terms.   I understand that it's a hurtful word to some people but honestly that doesn't change my stance of using it to describe objects or people. It's intent that is important - much in the same way as someone calling me a \"Scottish bastard\" would be important if they did it with malice. My English friend calls me a \"jock cunt\" and a \"faggot\" all the time but it doesn't even slightly offend me, and I've called him a  \"faggot\" and a \"northern monkey\".   I tried to refrain from mentioning that he is bisexual but it's pertinent. However much the \"my best friends are gay/black/disabled/mentally ill\" example is used it doesn't stop it from being true and relevant *sometimes*. So here we have a person who has had sexual intercourse with men in the past who can not only use the word \"faggot\" (and more to the point the word \"gay\") but also hear it said towards him without taking offense because the intent is not to comment on his sexuality but to use the word in the more meaningful (to use at least) \"internet context\".   To that end I *would* be more hesitant to use \"faggot\" in real life because a larger proportion of the population has not been on the internet and would take it to mean what it originally did - my argument is that the words \"gay\" and \"faggot\" have different meanings now, to those with the \"right intent\" i.e. people who don't hold the LGB community as a lower class of citizen.   Frankly I welcome the fact that both of these words have become less barbed in their use. Using them both as a replacement for \"bad\" is far less destructive than using them to convey your complete distaste for gay people. Hopefully, the same will happen with the word \"nigger\" but that's a long way off.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I kind of agree with this but you have to remember that \"gay\" has had different meanings throughout history. It originally meant you were joyous then some how it turned into a word to describe homosexuals. Many words that are considered to be \"bad\" words had different meanings at one point. When you call someone a dick or a cunt you don't actually think that person is genitalia. When I called someone gay when I was younger, did I actually think that person was a homosexual?   It is different when you call someone a derogatory word to their face such as faggot and queer. You are actually making an attempt to bully that person.  While calling someone gay jokingly hurts no one.   The real problem in my eyes is that we are too easily offended.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t You say it's intent that's important. But why would intent be more important than effect?  Sure, if you call your buddy a faggot behind closed doors, no one is harmed and there's no real problem. But as a widespread phenomena, the world is full of a heck of a lot more people than your age group and social sphere or people with your sense of humour.   When a kid hears someone say \"gay\" or \"faggot\" as an insult, they know instinctually that it's a bad thing to be. And then maybe they hurl it at someone who actually is gay, because they've been steeped in the belief that gay is bad. Maybe it didn't happen around you, but it did and does happen to people our age group (I'm 24 too) and younger. All the fucking time.  When a homophobe hears you call people faggots and gays, they think you're on their side. Their viewpoint is validated.  When a person whose had faggot and gay used as a slur against them their whole lives hears you say it, they feel unsafe.  So yeah, to you and your friends, and some other people too, it's taken on a new meaning. But to a lot of people (I would argue most people) it hasn't. Especially \"gay\". Like seriously, that word isn't going anywhere as a term for homosexual. So if your intent is good, why would you use \"gay\" to mean \"bad\"?  It's just a joke to you, but it's a lot more than that to a lot of people. Why would your joke and your good intentions be more important?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t How are gay people around you supposed to tell the difference between innocent you and not-innocent homophobes when you both use them as insults in the same way despite the intent behind being different?   We aren't mind readers. When a homophobe calls me a faggot, it sounds basically the same as when a \"friend\" calls me a faggot.   If I hear you calling your bisexual friend a faggot and saying \"that's gay\" I'm gonna assume you're prejudiced towards gay people, don't care how your words affect those around you, and are generally immature and intellectually lazy. I'm not a mind reader.   When you use the language of racists I'm gonna assume you're probably racist. Go around saying \"that's gay\" and \"faggot\" and I'm gonna assume you're probably a homophobe to some extent because the majority of time, when people call me a faggot or say \"that's gay\", they are homophobic and being insulting towards me.   I'm not a mind reader, and even if your mate if fine with it, at the very least you don't give a crap how your words affect other gay people around you who overhear them and who have been subjected to them throughout their life and have traumatic memories attached to them. You don't care what traumatic memories you might be causing, you don't care how annoying it can get for others having to hear it everywhere they go in life, you don't care if you're perpetuating dehumanisation and oppression *regardless* of your lack of  \"intent\" to do so   I honestly can't see why anyone would want to say \"faggot\" or \"that's gay\" when it makes you look like a intellectually deficient immature man child lol. It literally impresses nobody and doesn't make you look good in any way.   Usually I just assume you have to cling onto these lazy and generic words because your vocabulary isn't big enough to find new words to use.\n",

The goal is the shame them into feeling inferior. Certainly the point here is that you shouldn't want to be the thing you are ebbing accused of. It's not as simple as being denied you're own identity. It is that but also suggesting you're the \"wrong\" identity.   No one goes around calling everyone they dislike straight. They call them gay. The point is to say \"you're the wrong sexuality\". Not simply that you've failed to live up to your own sexuality. But that there is a good one and a bad one and you're the bad one.    Think about where gay is most prominent as an insult: middle school. Kids in middle school are still trying to sort their sexuality out. It is unclear to many who and what they like. They don't yet have a strong sexuality present and yet every day they are being thrown insults that say to them \"you're gay. And gay is bad. You should feel bad about the idea that you might be gay\". But some of those kids are gay. They're being told \"you're supposed to be straight but your actually the bad sexuality. You're gay. Feel bad about that\". And guess what, many do. Suicide rates are much night for lgbt teens because, in part, they're told repeatedly their whole life that there is a wrong sexuality to have. And then they realize they have it.   \"That's so gay\" is not a simple matter of calling someone something they're not. You know this. It is obvious. Especially when it is primarily used on people who haven't yet sorted their sexuality. It is about shaming people into a heteronormativity that will never work for them. \n",

What matters *is* my viewpoint when I'm the one who is using the word (which is just a word). The meaning and intent I put behind a word means everything with regards to the end result. To be honest though, I haven't used \"gay\" to describe anything in quite a while - not sure why.  At the end of the day, I'm not going to allow myself to either be censored because someone might find a word offensive, nor will I ever agree with anyone suggesting that I am somehow indirectly supporting bigotry by using a word in a way that has absolutely no relation to \"I hate you because you like men\". I do understand your point of view, I just don't agree with it.

That's an extremely poor analogy. Calling someone a dirty intellectual is inherently offensive (since being a \"dirty\" anything is bad).

Some historical outlines can be seen [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgenderism_and_transsexualism#Feminist_criticism) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgenderism_and_transsexualism#Feminist_exclusion_of_transgender_and_transsexual_people)  So saying that feminism \"is becoming openly hostile to minorities, particularly poor minorities\" is a misguided analysis of the movement because it lacks acknowledgment of the movement's past. Heck, the example you used demonstrates the core reason, that the mostly white figureheads of the movement overlook minority experiences, why the black feminist movement started in the first place.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t WRONG. It was not \"one feminist\". The video was shot by a man who was paid to do so by a women's activist group. The woman was paid to walk around ignoring poor black people. And it was thousands of feminists that popularized that bit of hate speech.   Do you understand the difference? She was an actress. A white woman was cast in the role of the \"victim\" in that video. How did they \"cast\" the villains? By shooting most of their video in a poor black neighborhood in Harlem. That isn't where you shoot if you want diversity. But since this is a professional publicity company doing the shooting, I'm not going to assume it was an accident, and neither should anyone else.  And guess what? When it comes to gender discussion, \"the establishment\" is feminism. That's the  mainstream, and this wounded doe underdog act isn't going to fly when your movement is making recruitment videos for white supremacist groups. \n",

This unique IP address is used to identify your computer as the source of available files to all other computers on a P2P network. The infringement notice you received is the result of your computer having been identified as engaged in an illegal transfer of copyrighted music.

(This is true for the general users, but mostly not true for servers and routers, the big ass core routers and servers owned by ISPs and internet companies).    So, if I see an IP address, I can pin-point to a rough geographical area where the machine with that IP address may be located. Now, usually, people are connected to a NAT Box (popularly called 'routers'). This NAT Box has a public IP address and users connect to it over a private IP address. The IP address a public eavesdropper sees will be of this NAT Box.    Now, coming to TOR. TOR does route your traffic around to make it difficult to trace the source. But, someone with enough time can do it. Also, now that the FBI has it's own servers serving as TOR nodes, they can trace the original IP address a little more easily.    Another way to circumvent tracing is to use VPN. But that only works as long as your VPN provider is willing to stand up to the government.   So, this is why it is possible to pin-point that a device with a X.Y.Z.W IP address may be in this rough geographical area. TOR and VPN can make things difficult, but not impossible.\n",

The transition periods from cold to warm or warm to cold tend to involve massive ecosystem disruptions, with many plants and animals going extinct and others exploding in population as they enter ecosystems that lack natural predators or limits on their growth. A current climate change related example is the bark and spruce beetle infestations killing forests across the Mountain West and taiga regions of North America. These were formerly held in check by cold temperatures, but now the climate has warmed enough that they experience much lower winter mortality and in some areas can even have two generations in a single breeding season, where previously they could only manage one. For example, the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska has lost 70-80% of its spruce trees within the last ~20 years. These types of disruptions happen much more quickly than the process of evolution and adaptation that will eventually heal them, which leaves the next umpteen generations of humans a world of massive ecological chaos and devastation.

They might not be Christian but they need a common numbering system.   CE implies that *everyone* should consider the putative arrival of the Christian messiah as ushering in a new era for humanity. By saying that the Christian calendar is the \"common\" one, it's positioning Christianity as the default, the center, implying that everything else is niche or an aberration. \n",

They *don't* believe that Jesus was the Christ, so to go around saying \"Oh, but that was the year that the Christ came\" literally goes against everything they believe in.

It helps the reader understand the nature of the author and of the text. In the same way, using CE and BCE make the text sound  more academic.  Also, I don't see why you see this as anti-Christian. It feels a little persecution-complexy - we're still using the date scale precisely because it would be too much of  a hassle to switch over.

      "\t\t>>\t Actually I think OP is on to something.  Lets take three examples: Mickey Mouse, Elvis, and Animal Farm.  All of these were huge when they came out.  All of these were deserving of copyright protection.  Yet how do we decide when that protection should be evaporated?  Why not make one of the relevant factors a continued use of the copyright?  For example Disney is producing millions of mouse ear hats per year and using that little guy as a mascot like crazy.  Somehow, god knows how, kids today still know who he is and want to see him when they go to disney world.  So why on earth would we want that copyright protection to evaporate?    Animal farm on the otherhand is a tremendously important work but no one is going to be making a movie of it to preserve the copyright in it.  It is still probably selling a pretty good number of copies every year but at some point no one is still investing in it and it should pass to the public domain as the author has reaped the vast majority of the financial rewards that could be taken from his work.  Elvis is another good example.  Still a huge fan base and they should be able to keep churning out CDs, coffee mugs, etc.  But you can see that it is already getting a bit long in the tooth.  Kids today don't ask for trips to graceland, elvis did not turn into the next disney and we can see that ten, twenty, thirty years into the future no one is going to want to be reinvesting into the life of elvis for the sake of preserving a few tens of thousand a year in content sales.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > Somehow, god knows how, kids today still know who he is and want to see him when they go to disney world. So why on earth would we want that copyright protection to evaporate?  Because it's popular, therefore the public has an interest in it.   If it would evaporate, anyone could make *mouse ear hats* make MickeyMouse cartoons, and our pop-culture would be freer for it.   Copyright exists for our sake, not for Disney's. We give up part of our freedom and ability to copy, to sell, to produce, to sing, to watch, and even to create art,  so artists can have a stable revenue stream from monopolizing these options, and they can exist in an industry, and create more art *for us*.   The goal is not just to let them earn as much money as they can, but to let them earn as much money as absolutely necessery, before we can lift these monopolies and censorship restrictions from the public.   Do we, as a society, benefit from Disney making billions from old franchises, or we would be better off if after an initial theatre run, and a few years of merchandising (which easily profits several times over for anything but huge flops), it would be free for all others to have a go at it? \n",
      "\t\t>>\t >but my idea of it wouldn't consider that to count (and this would need to be reflected in the definition).  The biggest issue I see is that there is no way to appropriately make a legal definition for \"use\" of a copyrighted idea that would exclude derivative works, and as a result such valueless pieces of \"art\" would be churned out to meet the \"continued use\" requirements, and that these have negative value as \"art\"  >The copyrighted work itself would have to be made available, not just something based on it.   There are all sorts of issues with drawing the line, for instance is a \"purposefully\" bad rendition of the original idea (for sake of, say, parody or comedic purposes) legally distinguishable from a legitimately bad production? I guess you could say common sense, but then again with things like comedy, some old judge is definitely going to hold different views than, say, your average college student. Is there any way to actually write continued use laws to exclude such legitimately bad productions, while also not going overboard and crossing the brink of censorship?  >Or are you suggesting that all media would become low-budget and not as good because of this?  I don't think all media will succumb to this, but highly valuable properties certainly will. Say you're a company that holds the rights to Spiderman, and you personally don't have access to the writers/staff/whatever to make a really good Spiderman movie. Instead of giving it up to another company that could make one, you could just as easily make a really *bad* Spiderman movie that they can still make a slight profit off of (because it's Spiderman) so that a) other companies don't make money and b) if they ever do get the rights, it now has a negative rep in the public's eye, making it less valuable   Ultimately I think it's better that we let certain ideas remain unused, than create restrictions that would only encourage the production of meaningless movies/shows, which is what I believe to be the inevitable fate of \"continued use\" provisions\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I would argue that we benefit, as a society, from Disney retaining its copyright over Mickey Mouse - and Mickey is a perfect example because he is nothing except what Disney put into him.  That mouse is a symbol of the corporation.  he doesn't have a personality, he doesn't have a back story, he doesn't have any depth except as a symbol promoted and advertised like a trademark.  Sure they might toss that mouse into video games, or children's cartoons, etc. but there isn't a character to speak of.  If we did pull the copyright would people suddenly spring up to turn him into a fleshed out character?  No - you might as well start with your own character as using him wouldn't save you any work.  What it would do is cause an economic disruption to the Disney corporation, reduce its profitability, and force it to pour money into a new symbol that it would now have to worry about expiring with time as well.  We would be destroying Disney's goodwill without creating anything in turn.  Who would benefit by putting Mickey in the public domain?  I am sure there are a lot of people out there who are eager to put him into pornography as a way of both shocking people's sensibilities (specifically because he is such a recognized symbol), and shitty warehouse owners eager to make a few bucks stamping out cheap, crappy, mouse ears.  Why on earth should be be helping those people?  Yes copyright's origin is providing content creators, and their families, a stream of income from the fruits of their work during their lifetimes, but surely if a piece of IP is still producing huge revenues close to a hundred years on we are dealing with something outside of that view that is also worth protecting.    I acknowledge there really is a conflict between what you are suggesting, art as a conversation that requires dynamic contribution by different voices for the benefit of all, and profiting from IP you created.  But if I wanted to actually contribute something to the public, some smart commentary I had about Mickey Mouse, I could do it in different ways.  I can make Road Runner without the road runner being Mickey Mouse.  I can make spaceballs without apropriating the star wars name.  I can make fifty shades of grey without appropriating twilight. Heck it is actually really rare for someone to take a public domain work and really do something of public merit with it.  What public domain really does is stop us from having to figure out who owns, and how much they should be paid, every single little piece of media that is ancient.  That is a hugely useful function in this day and age but no one is out there trying to remake the vast, vast, majority of old public domain works.    Where there are exceptions to this the new author is creating their own value as opposed to just appropriating it.  You want to make a Dracula movie, a From the Earth to the Moon remake, a Pride and Prejudice Series you had better be bringing something new and wonderful to the table or it is going to flop and you will lose a bunch of money.  The simple fact that Pride and Prejudice is being remade isn't automatically going to turn out crowds - you have to market, you have to show people you got something good for them. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t > I would argue that we benefit, as a society, from Disney retaining its copyright over Mickey Mouse - and Mickey is a perfect example because he is nothing except what Disney put into him.  Actually, that makes it a pretty bad example of copyrights, because you are really talking about trademarks.   Not Mickey Mouse as a work of fiction, but Mickey Mouse as a logo like the Golden Arches, or the Apple, or the Pepsi Globe. That has *nothing* to do with creative work or ownership of original ideas, that's about businesses not being allowed to fake an identification where certain shapes would clearly imply one.   > But if I wanted to actually contribute something to the public, some smart commentary I had about Mickey Mouse, I could do it in different ways. I can make Road Runner without the road runner being Mickey Mouse.  So what? Just because there is a silver lining to censorship, that at least artists can always create something else, (that might be even more original), that doesn't mean that censorship is an entirely neutral or good thing, it's still messing with artists to protect others.   When the Hayes Code banned sex and violence in movies, that led to the rise of the bible epic genre, since those were still allowed to be violent and sexy as long as they followed the gcripture. Great classics, like The Ten Commandments, and Ben-Hur, were born that way.   This doesn't mean that the Hayes Code was a great thing, it was still petty censorship, and competent artists could have just as easily created something great *without it*.   Just because the public is forbidden from making a Mickey Mouse cartoon, or a Star Wars movie, or write a Narnia novel, doesn't mean that what they do instead of it is any better. Just look at 50 Shades. Being forced to search&replace some character names didn't make it any better, meanwhile there are plenty of talented creators who have shown their ability to tell great stories in licensed or public domain universes.   I would rather have them be free to do more like that, whwn that feels appropriate than forbid them to create certain types o art, for their own good.   > Heck it is actually really rare for someone to take a public domain work and really do something of public merit with it.  I can still think of plenty. J. M. Coetzee's Foe, Margaret Atwood's Penelopiad,  Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Alan Moore's League of the Extraordinary Gentlemen, Disney's animated canon (most of it), and these are just some of the highest unquestionable reputation,  there are also the regular decent works that are roughly as good as all the other IPs of the same calibre.   > Where there are exceptions to this the new author is creating their own value as opposed to just appropriating it. You want to make a Dracula movie, a From the Earth to the Moon remake, a Pride and Prejudice Series you had better be bringing something new and wonderful to the table or it is going to flop and you will lose a bunch of money.  But that dynamic could also be expanded to much younger works, if only they were Public Domain.   Maybe there are so few public domain based works, because by necessity they are all forced to be period pieces, which is a single niche. Cut copyright back to the original 28 years, and you would see the same principle apply to Superman, Star Wars, Spiderman, Lord of the Rings, etc. Right now, we are getting their sequels up the wazoo, because as long as a single company owns them, they all serve as little monopolies, edges that they can use to undercut each other, by holding our yearly doses of them.   If Star Wars would be as public domain as Pride and Prejudice, then (at least after the few years of moronic gold rush),  a status quo would set up where Star Wars is not a scarce, valuable franchise, since anyone can use it, it's just an important milestone of 20th century pop culture, that is only interesting by it's transformation.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Ok so there are 2 reasons I said my predicted scenario is likely. Going back to the Spiderman example, there are 2 reasons a company may produce a derivative work if they see the property to be valuable enough to keep others from using it: >a) other companies don't make money and b) if they ever do get the rights, it now has a negative rep in the public's eye, making it less valuable  I'll add to that: c) if a company can produce a movie that is of actual low quality, but still very profitable (like a scaled down Michael Bay summer blockbuster) they can not only use that fulfill continued use requirements but also use it to market other products, like toys and such. Even if they barely break even on the film, profit from other sources might be enough to make such an act worthwile  So here are 3 potential motives for a company to make a derivative work instead of letting it go to the public.  In response to your side note, I don't think any proposed solution could be achieved that current copyright holders would find agreeable (as they would inevitably be on the losing end of such an agreement). Also, I think the only real solution would be to either 1) drastically decrease the length one can hold a copyright, or 2) condition copyright claims not on continued \"use\" but on continued investment of *financial resources* with respect to the company's financial assets. Neither idea is fleshed out at all, but I can think about it more if you'd like  (also, it might take a while for my next response, so sorry about that in advance)\n",

The only difference is that it's not chemically induced, so there's no chemical dependency to worry about.

If you start by modeling the earth as flat, you can still effectively navigate short distances. For slightly longer distances, you can just add correction terms to explain discrepancies.

Some are more obvious than other, and they don't overlap 100% with each other, but they offer alternative ways to look at the same thing.    I'm sorry but your initial assumptions on how economists view markets are just wrong. I've explicitly detailed how and why for you in my previous post. As such, the premise that economists are starting off by modeling with knowledge akin to \"the earth as flat\" as their starting premise is simply faulty.  >The fact is, it takes more work to do it. It take more time, it takes better paid economists, so it happens with less frequency than the application of a simpler framework.  Again, it works the other way around. Economic research that is not utilizing as inclusive and extensive modeling as possible to account for as many variables are often too simply and thus dismissed in economic theory.  The leading schools of thought and economic theory are backed with extensive and far-reaching math.   That's like saying because the math is harder to do, physics is dominated by theories using simple mathematics and elementary modeling. That's just untrue. While simpler modeling is easier to do in both fields, they're taken less seriously.  >I agree, it has an effect. Sometimes it's the primary effect. But, when you have to correct the math for every little cost that comes up, you're never going to be able to take it all into account.  The consequence of economic modeling is that some variables will inevitably be left out. They cannot all be considered. That is impossible to do. That is why economists try to capture as much of them as possible. You won't get a 100% accurate replication of the real world. That is, again, impossible.

Let's say a man and a woman have sex and the woman gets pregnant. If she doesn't want to birth a child she can abort it, if she doesn't want to have a child she can give it up for adoption; either way a year after the pregnancy it's like it never happened, it's just a memory with no implications on the present. The man in this situation has no options. If the woman aborts it, that was her right and the baby is gone, I don't know of anyone who argues for forcing a woman to birth a baby. That point is not fought.   The key point is here though, what if the woman decides to keep the baby. The woman exercised her right to birth a baby and has chosen to keep it. The man had no say in the baby's birth (which is fair) but ALSO has no choice in if the baby is kept. He is obligated to pay child support and has no option not to. The woman has the option to avoid parenthood with adoption services but the man gets his option picked for him by the woman's choice.

What would you say to the argument that the man should be financially responsible for a fair proportion of the extra expenses that arise due to the pregnancy, but could still be off the hook after the child is born?  And to keep things simple, we'll assume that the woman knew that the man didn't want a child before they had sex, that he took reasonable precautions against it happening, and that he had no reason to believe that the woman would keep the baby if she did get pregnant.  There doesn't even need to be any deception - she could have just changed her mind after she was pregnant.  Basically this is something that she wants, something that he didn't want, something that she knew he didn't want, and something that he had no idea  she wanted.

In case 2 I would argue that if the women goes ahead with keeping a child that the man specifically DOESNT want, the man should be clear of any financial responsibility. Some other people have argued that the situation for women is unfair because they actually have to carry the child and the biology of the situation. That's assuming they waited to have the child. If a woman goes through with an entire pregnancy and doesn't abort her child then SHE made the decision to have that child, not the man. Women know the outcome of sex just as much as men, sometimes they result in babies, why a man has to pay for a child he doesnt want doesnt make sense to me. We havent even discussed the very real situation in many households where the women are currently the breadwinners and make substantially more money than their S.O. Many women abuse this system and try to get pregnant with wealthy men in illegitimate situations to abuse this law. I would have to add though that the one reason i feel the status quo is fair is the fact that we have a lot of fucked up places in america where a poor disenfranchised women wont have adequate access to a safe abortion option, in that case the baby is coming whether you like it or not, and i do feel the guy has to cough up the cash in that sad and unfortunate situation.  Case 3 i feel is even more important. The emotional toll it would have to be in love with a women, hear that she has conceived your child, and then hear immediately that she doesnt feel like shes ready and wants to get rid of it, can be extremely traumatic for a lot of men. There was a story about it on relationships a while ago that just broke my heart. The girl basically told the dude (im paraphrasing) \"you're a great guy, but im not exactly head over heels for you. i just dont feel that way and I'm going to take care of it.\" True, its only a collection of few generic cells, this isnt a pro life pro choice discussion, but that doesnt change the fact that a lot of guys view this as a very personal and damaging situation to be in.

Unless you support that statement in its entirety, you're accepting that it is morally and legally acceptable for someone to bring a child into the world with the understanding that the child will not have the resources and benefits associated with having two parents.  Given that this is acceptable, it's illogical to accept that a mother is not free to make the same choice in a case where the father is theoretically available but has preemptively disowned the child; in doing so, you must by nature validate the father's decision to do so.  To illustrate the point, if you accepted the first statement as true, you would have to accept that a woman who failed to undergo abortion despite the knowledge that her male partner would be unavailable to provide support for the child (regardless of why) would *herself* be engaging in an act that should rightly be punishable by law.  The wording's convoluted, I know, so it may take a couple tries, but it does make sense.  (I'm not calling you stupid, I'm calling my wording awkward.)  Basically, either it's acceptable for someone to unilaterally decide that a child will come into the world with only one parent or it isn't.  If it isn't, you have to throw the book at not just voluntary single mothers, but widows as well.  If it is, that decision cannot be meaningfully divided by gender, especially because a woman has the option of abortion in response to such a decision by her partner.  Justice is allowing both men and women to make an affirmative choice whether to become parents based on the limitations implied by their biology.  There is no justice in allowing women the right to abortion while holding men legally responsible for a decision they had no part in making.  I know I'm not being particularly eloquent here, but from where I'm standing this should pretty much be a no-brainer.\n",

That's not fair either.  While it's impossible to make this whole uncomfortable situation fully fair for everyone, a man being able to financially dissolve his ties to the child (with, perhaps, some compensatory requirement to attempt to legally make up the difference you rightly bring up) is far more fair than the current situation where a woman's choice to have or not have a baby has decades of financial consequences for the father that he has no control over.\n",

For all intents and purposes, a man using some form of legal abortion is undergoing the *exact same process* as one who (with his partner) decides to place a child for adoption; the only difference is that the resulting child is \"adopted\" by the biological mother (should she herself choose neither abortion nor adoption) rather than an unrelated party.\n",

The implication that he would necessarily be able to just walk away the morning after is false, they are both responsible for the pregnancy.  Assuming he does not want a child, we could have it so that it would not be until after one of these things has been completed that his obligations would be done:  1. The woman has opted for *and completed* an abortion.  2. The woman has opted for adoption, *has carried the baby to term, and the adoption is complete.*  3. The woman has opted to keep and raise the baby *and has carried the baby to term.*  Note that there is also no reason why a woman might not opt out as well, yet carry to term and let the baby be raised by the man if she doesn't want to and he does.

      "\t\t>>\t Not guaranteed,  by written law.  However,  judges, unless complete idiots,  would never grant custody, even partial,  to a rapist.   Many states do have specific laws revoking custody from rapists.  However I'm pretty sure those require a conviction.   Though frankly, as the law sits,  they're not a rapist if not found guilty.     The problems with custody and child support involving \"rape\" where the offender is granted parental rights of support or custody,  isn't actual rape but statutory rape,  these cases are under a slightly different color of law,  as the offender and victim are not necessarily risk laden when it comes to the welfare of the child.  Even though if convicted they'd likely dissolve any parental rights anyhow.   Ultimately this particular matter isn't one of regular concern,  or even of minor concern.   At very worst,  the rape victim will have to fight the custody in court, which can be a pain in the ass,  plus a traumatic bit considering their rapist is the plaintiff.   But to be actually awarded custody for their efforts,  I'm not sure a case as such even exists in the US (statutory rape excluded) and if it does, it's exceedingly rare.  \n",
      "\t\t>>\t >Abortion is not always an available option for women.   The number of women for whom abortion is not a *medical* option is very small.  The availability of abortion as a *practical* option (due to cost or location issues, for example) is an issue of execution rather than morality or legality.  The solution to issues with abortion availability is not arbitrarily depriving all men of reproductive autonomy, it's fixing issues related to abortion availability.  >And even when it is, abortion affects a woman in ways that it does not and can not affect men.  Absolutely, but what does this have to do with the argument or point at hand?  Fundamentally, the existence of abortion means that women do *not* necessarily have to carry a pregnancy to term, let alone give birth and then take legal/financial responsibility for the resulting child.  Which are closer, abortion and legal/paper/financial abortion or abortion and forced legal/biological parenthood?  It isn't really a complicated question, and as far as legal fairness (and justice, for that matter) are concerned it makes sense for us to opt for the more analogous of the two.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t But to be fair, the alternative is carrying the child to term which can also affect the woman in ways that does not and cannot affect men. Also, adoption is an alternative that would involve the same degree of stress and pain as if you kept the child for yourself (although obviously not exactly the same since you go through all that stress and pain for nothing; since the child is given away).  Also of note is that early-pregnancy abortion is a very safe and practical for most women (of note is the regional differences -- in my area, abortion is freely available and doesn't even require parental consent). The early-pregnancy options are arguably easier, safer, and less painful than carrying the child to term.  Admittedly, there's the emotional issue as well, which I admit I do not really consider (this is a moral issue and I do not really have any attachment to unborn children). However, I see this as a trade off. You can have the child if you really want, but you can't expect someone else to pay for them.  And it's not like it's the only moral issue where you have to make such kinds of trade offs. What if the father had died? You still have the same question of whether or not to raise the child, but this time you most certainly will not be getting child support (at least I don't think you can get child support from the dead -- if so, change this hypothetical scenario to the father also being broke).  As an aside, if we're going to consider the moral issue here, we should consider it the other way around, too. What if the mother doesn't want the child but the father does? He's not in a position to get the child (I don't think any rational person would argue that the woman should be forced to carry the child to term). Yet, if he's morally against abortion or similar, then he might be affected by the abortion in ways that the woman does not!\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Can be, however the disparity in award v. economic position between males and females is very distinct.   \n",
      "\t\t>>\t Good point. Usually happens for existing children, though, since if a woman gets pregnant and doesn't want the child, an abortion is entirely her choice and no court system can say otherwise (at least in my country).  In fact, I do not argue against child support for existing children; only for the case of an unborn child.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Well it's not a case of playing draw, but more to the point:    - once conceptions occurs, she is either pregnant for 9 months or has to go through a medical abortion procedure.  She can't just \"wish it hadn't happened\" and sign a paper and walk out.   - both pregnancy and abortion are psychological as well as physical burdens.   - if the child is born, she can't opt out of child support.    The only choice the female has that the male does not is pregnancy vs. abortion ONLY because pregnancy happens in her body.  A female cannot choose on another woman's body nor can the female choose that the male be pregnant instead.  \n",

      "\t\t>>\t >The child has a right to be supported by it's parents  Only persons who consented to create the child are parents. Otherwise they are no more that sperm/egg donors, with neither responsibilities nor rights over the child.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > The father is permitted to financially abort, but loses any right to see the child (something similar to a restraining order).  Was this in any doubt?   A financial abortion would mean eliminating all parental rights. Just as people who adopt out their kids lose parental rights.  It would make no sense for someone who enacts financial abortion to have any parental rights whatsoever.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Regarding the restraining order thing, I would think that would be unnecessary. Surely the kind of person who financially aborts has no interest in being a father.  A restraining order just create issues and complicates what would otherwise be a very simple process. For example, consider the case of someone who has sex with someone, financially aborts, and then in a few years, has children of his own. His children could end up going to the same school as the kid he has a restraining order against, which obviously causes issues.  Besides, what would we need a restraining order for? The guy is not a threat or anything. He just doesn't want to pay for the kid. That's not what restraining orders are for.  If the guy ends up being a crazy stalker, sure, get a restraining order then, but that's completely unrelated from the fact that he financially aborted.  Of course, there's the issue of when the father \"financially aborts\" but stays with the family (ie, just saying that he doesn't want to pay child support if he ever leaves) which could be handled in the same way that we already do: child support is dependent on whether or not you support the child. It's not automatically given and would have to be requested if either parent decides to stop supporting the child. And presumably if the family gets back together, the child support payments would stop. This requires a court system with some discretion, which seems like a challenge (okay, that was a bit snarky, but we can't deny that the courts can be extremely inconsistent), but not unbelievable.  As an aside, a complete alternative could be to use basic income here. You may be familiar with that (if not, checkout /r/basicincome). It usually covers adults, but could easily cover children, too. The children's pay could be given to the parents until they child becomes an adult and could be appropriately chosen so that it's always enough to raise the child. I don't consider people having many children to get money to be an issue since child support already exists and the basic income would only be enough to raise a child and not significantly such that you could become rich from it.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Yes, it'd be a much bigger hassle... And where would this money come from, to take care of all these kids? I can already hear the righteous anger of taxpayers having to fund these slutty mothers' drinking/drug/gambling habits along with their bastard brats. Note that most of the flak will be on the mother in this situation, because the father is absent and virtually impossible to ID or point fingers at.  Not to mention that now that there's virtually no repercussion for impregnating a woman (because there's no way in *hell* the gov't is all powerful enough to monitor the father's every move), why not impregnate another woman?\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Agreed, but by that logic, both should be held responsible because the pregnancy was a result of both parties' actions.  The problem arises when only one has a say in the matter.  Edit: Otherwise, you'd either have to argue that women are entirely responsible for what happens to their bodies (and men aren't responsible for what they do to them), thus allowing men to financially abort, or that men are entirely responsible for what they do to women's bodies (and women aren't responsible for what happens to theirs), giving them no decision.  Each of those options operate on a complete lack of agency on one side, making it difficult to find a middle ground when both parties are held accountable for their actions.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Not acceptable =/= not preferable, and sometimes the state has an interest in the latter as well.   I get what you're saying, but there's no reason that a law couldn't distinguish between situations like those you mention. It's not such a reductio ad absurdum in reality.\n",

There are lots of business agreements that are illegal even if everyone involved agrees to them. Suicide pacts and assassin for hire is just the tip of the iceburg. Prostitution is another. Any kind of forced labor or slavery is the third.If you agree to do work and then refuse to do it, the other guy is entitled to compensation, but they can't expect a cop to come over and force you to dig that ditch at gunpoint just because you signed an agreement. You are also not allowed to sell your organs or kids. You can't enter into a sale of goods for the purposes of tax evasion. I could go on and on. Lots of people have signed business agreements against their will. A LOT of landholders have been forced to sell their property due to developers forcing them to do so, for example.  >No one can be forced into employment against their will, that would be illegal. If however, they sign a contract agreeing to, the law will hold them to the terms of that agreement (assuming those terms are within the existing law).  Now this is a much more accurate statement. You should have skipped the first one in favor of this. It's a much stronger point.  Here is the thing - the law does not consider money to be the same as physical labor. It hasn't since the days when slavery was legal. You cannot force anyone to do something they don't want to do under the law. You can force them to pay compensation, yes. Many people would rather do the work than pay the compensation, yes.  But you cannot force someone to use their body to do something they don't want to do in the non-criminal sphere. Not in any first world country anyway. This includes giving birth or having an abortion.  A cop will not follow you on stage and force you to sing words, no matter how many lawyers Sony has. They won't drag you into an abortion clinic against your will. All they will do is make sure you pay any compensation that a court orders for business agreements.  That's one of the issues here - you cannot equate forcing someone to give birth to forcing someone to pay fees. Any attempt to do so will and should fail.  Now, there ARE ways to approach this problem where you are not putting personal freedom up against financial freedom, and instead pitting financial obligations of two parties against each other. These arguments are the ones to go with, and have more support within both the legal and legislative communities.\n",

You act as if there is some magic button women can press that says yay baby or nay baby. And that the choice is based on how badly they want to fuck you over. Perhaps she doesn't want a child anymore than you do, but it isn't so simple for the one carrying the kid. The potential father could run away from the issue; the potential mother is forced to deal with it in one way or another.   Bottom line...

This is ridiculous, of course, but if it isn't true we basically have to accept that it is morally and legally acceptable for a parent to unilaterally place a child in a position where they will be deprived of one parent's support.  If that's true, it's actually *easier* to justify the male equivalent from a moral perspective, since a man preemptively disclaiming parenthood is much more likely to lead to an abortion (and no child to be deprived of anything) than a woman voluntarily becoming a single parent (which effectively guarantees it).

      "\t\t>>\t As the other guy mentioned, those specific situations aren't excluded (the logic is supposed to be that child support is for the child's benefit and not the mother, but theory doesn't always translate well into practice).  But even if we did just allow those two situations, I would still argue that the general idea (always being able to financially abort) should be an option. This really comes down to the fact that I believe nobody should have a child that they cannot afford. It's rational to not have a child (or want to abort if accidental pregnancy occurs) when money is tight. A law that forces otherwise goes against the original intent of the people having sex (I'm presuming that people who have sex do not want a child unless they discuss and agree before hand).  Further, requiring child support payments could be viewed as damaging to the payee. It's a major expense that can financially cripple those who don't have a lot of extra cash (which is quite a lot of people). Especially if you get thrown in prison if you can't make the payment *yet still have to make future payments* (despite prison obviously ruining your finances even more).  However, I should note that I'm referring solely to cases where the an unwanted pregnancy occurs and not cases where a family with existing children separates (which is very different).  There's also the case of when the father is not informed until after the birth or if the father cannot be found. It's my opinion that in those cases, the father would be absolved from paying child support (unless they want to, but that's something for them to do personally and not a court matter). This is because if finances are an issue, the woman always has the power to abort or put the child up for adoption.  As you can tell, I have very strong views against having children that you're knowingly not financially able to support. This is a utilitarian view that won't be popular with many, but I believe to be very rational and maximizes economical fairness.\n",

Even if she gets an abortion, she's still forced to have a pregnancy as the result of a rape, and either have an invasive medical procedure to get out of that situation or carry a rapist's baby for 9 months if abortion is not an option.  Ok. So? How is that relevant?  >This is like saying motherhood that is not consented to is forced.  Motherhood and pregnancy are not the same thing.   >Having consenting sex with a person of the opposite gender is consent to be a parent, period.  Morally, it is not.

That is unjust.  >Women are obligated to be financially responsible for their children, what are you talking about?

However, even if there is deception going on **no** birth control aside from total removal of reproductive organs is 100% effective and pregnancy is a known outcome of sex.  I disagree with this bit. Sex is mostly a recreational activity for many. It's like saying that is you drive, that's consent to die in an accident.

Except even a man who does everything he is supposed to can be forced into parenthood.   Take a man who discusses kids before having sex, and he only has sex within committed relationships, with women who agree they don't want kids. And he makes sure that birth control is used.  If a woman pokes holes in the condoms and/or lies about being on birth control, he will still be forced to pay.  And that is of course 100% legal.\n",

Also, looking at the last items on your list, it's important to remember that it's not the government's job to write laws based on family and religious stupidity.  You're also now expanding things far beyond the scope of the original discussion by bringing in the global situation.  Remember, many of those countries you're talking about don't have much in the way of child support laws either.

      "\t\t>>\t Which would involve the mother putting together paperwork, documenting the illegal visits with as much evidence as possible for proof- it would have to be multiple visits, for a strong case- and then most likely lawyering up to actually produce repercussions.   If the guy's rich (and he'll likely be better off than mom, seeing as he isn't bringing up a kid), he may be able to line up a good defense attorney and maybe even win visitation rights to see the kid he wanted to abort.   The problem with this idea is that it places the burden on the mothers doorstep: first in taking care of the kid, and second in keeping the father away. All of this documenting, the court visits, and lawyer would cost women time, money, and effort to fight. Most people have enough difficulty investing their time, money, and effort in things that they *want* and are vital to *life*. Why make these ladies lives harder just to give men a \"get out of irresponsible sex free\" card?  Edit: I also want to clarify for you why women might decide to keep a kid even if they are in no way capable of raising one.   First off, there's a huge societal pressure to not abort- some families will straight up disinherit/have nothing to do with their daughters if they do so.   Second, it's not that easy to abort. In quite a few states, the doctors are legally required to do a little \"shaming speech\" about how far a long the kid is: whether or not the fetus will be able to feel pain, what features have developed, etc. This is an attempt to humanize the fetus, and make it feel more like murder.   Third is the access issue. Due to highly stringent regulations on facilities, in many states there are no more than a few facilities. This means that a woman has to drive several hours, or possibly fly to a different state, to get the procedure done. And I hope you realize that there would definitely have to be more than one visit before the abortion, and that the entire cost will be on the woman (insurers don't have to cover abortions).  Fourth is the health issue. A lot of men seem to think that abortion is easy and easily accessible (it isn't), without recognizing the potential health hazards for women. If it's done wrong, women can be seriously hurt. They can also become sterile, even plan b can fuck with your body if you use it too often. It's suggested to never take it more than twice.  And all of this ignores the massive potential for shaming on the way to a clinic: there are a number of facilities that bill themselves as abortion clinics, but in fact wait until the woman is vulnerable (re: undressed and in scrubs for their visit), and then verbally lambaste them for their choice. They can't leave, because the facility is keeping their clothes hostage. Some women walk out without their clothes in public just to escape.  Then there are the protesters who are routinely in front of the real facilities. And then, there's the fact that insurance providers also like to make birth control as hard as possible to get in the first place. When my sister recently went to pick up her birth control, they denied her first because she didn't have her prescription card, even though she had her insurance card. Then, when she provided her prescription card, her insurance provider insisted on having written notice from her doctor for the prescription, even though the doctor called the prescription in to the pharmacy for her in the first place.  Women already have all of these shitty impositions, now you want to place another shitty imposition on women where they're forced to be solely responsible for the kid? Do you guys really think women should universally be put between a rock and a hard place for all things related to sex?! Do men *want* to get laid?\n",

      "\t\t>>\t > But having sex doesn't enter you into a binding contract, even consensual sex. And a man isn't contractually bound to compensate for an agreement he never made.  You can state that, but it's not true just because you state it. There are lots of people who claim they don't have to pay taxes because they never agreed to (ie \"freemen\"), and it just plain doesn't work. You can't boil a social issue down to simple contract law. If you could, slavery would still be legal.  If the law says you have a legal obligation to support your offspring, then you do. Don't like it, fix the law. But you can't pretend the law doesn't exist when it's inconvenient.  Contracts are ONLY enforceable if society chooses to enforce them, and ONLY on the terms society deems appropriate. That's why a contract that *should* be valid, like an agreement between a prostitute and her customer, is not enforceable in areas where prostitution is illegal, and a contract to marry off a 9 year old is perfectly valid and enforceable in some jurisdictions even though it should not be.   **Contracts are not magical.** They have no power other than what society says they have. And society cares more about children's rights than and adults rights because adults have more options and choices than kids. To you, it's a support payment, to a kid, it's survival. Again, don't like it, change it. But that's the current state of affairs.  Here is the thing. Society has a responsibility to make sure that children are taken care of. Every politician ever elected will tell you that one of their platforms was the protection of the innocent. It's not up for debate.  The real question is, who should pay? Me, as a taxpayer? I didn't didn't get anyone pregnant. Even if a guy was fraudulently made a father, he STILL has more of a connection to the child than I do. Than anyone does.  Is that fair? No. Is it more unfair than creating a system where anyone could abandon a child at anytime for any reason? No. And that's where we are: the lessor of 2 evils.  It's not about fairness. It's about choosing a lesser wrong over a greater one. The father might feel innocent in all this, but the kid is even more innocent. Pure and simple. I know this because I asked the same question in law school and got the same answer from someone who was not only a law prof, but also a family court judge.  Bottom line, legally, you are responsible for the results of your actions. And even when you are not responsible for your actions due to drunkeness or fraud, they were STILL your actions, not some random strangers. You are more closely connected than a random stranger on the other side of the country. Therefore it's more fair to dump the problem on you than them.  **Where things are not fair is that men and women are currently held to different levels of responsibility.** That's the real crux of the issue. Arguing contract law creates a very weak position. It's just plain a bad argument. There are better ones to use.  **The real issue is the difference in obligations between men and women, and the lack of consequences for misbehavior resulting in a child. That's not contract law**. Bringing in contract law just weakens any arguments you may have. Never use contract law if you have any other option. It's almost always the weakest argument.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t > Bradley Amendment  Although the Bradley Amendment is a poorly written piece of legislation (IMO it's unconstitutional) it's not a rebuttal to the judicial force issue.   The Bradley Amendment basically makes failure to pay a federal criminal matter in a similar manner as contempt of court. As such, it very much IS in the criminal sphere. It specifically overrides contract and civil law, which would not allow many of the injustices caused by it.  The purpose behind the legislation is noble, which is usually what creates the worst laws. Everyone is in such a hurry to be seen to be doing the right thing they don't bother checking to see if they are inadvertently doing some wrong or stupid things.

That's probably part of why there's a discrepancy between the woman being allowed to abort and the man not being able to give up financial responsibility - the woman is aborting something that is still a part of her body, ergo not a socially independent entity, whereas the man is \"aborting\" a new member of society, a real person. That carries many more problems for society, which now has to care for this real person by providing the education, healthcare, housing, etc that its birth father refused it. Conversely, only the biological mother has to care for her foetus (outside of any state abortion funding, which may be in place because it's cheaper to pay for abortions than to pay for unwanted babies). If that is indeed the rationale, then I don't see financial abortion ever becoming a thing. I'm pulling this together from my background knowledge only, but considering that most of developed countries' birth rate comes from the lower classes, where alimony payments would be a strain on the father (add class-specific issues with marriage rates and parental abandonment rates, racial and ethnic specifics), giving fathers the option to give up their children financially would put an unconscionable strain on the state budget. Plus, so far I only see a pejorative effect on the already low birth rates of developed countries. Family law definitely needs reform in view of the advancing demographic crisis, but I don't think this is necessarily it.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t I'm sorry for instigating the long comment. I'm not trying to flame you, I'm trying to argue against your argument. Someone brought up contract law and you stated that breaking a contract will make someone responsible for compensation. My argument was simply that the compensation analogy is a bad foot to stand on, as you might agree since you said drawing an analogy between contract law and abortion is a poor choice.   If people started assuming what obligations fall under sex, we might not have legal abortions now. A common argument against abortion was that women decided to take on their responsibilities as an adult when they had sex, and it certainly isn't the fetus' fault that it's alive. It doesn't choose to attach itself, it's forced there by it's parents. The law supported this idea for a very long time, and it was eventually changed by long debates and spreading information to gain support.  This debate is similar. The current law should be changed if it is considered unfit by a large portion of the population. At least, a large enough portion to consider a compromise. I'm not trying to evade the law, I'm trying to keep the law from making assumptions about my obligations after I've consented to sex, which is a similar thinking to what led to legalizing abortions. This debate supports opening the law to more freedom and less responsibility.  Naturally, you get people who support freedom for themselves and people who support responsibility for others, especially when there is something to gain. I get flustered by these debates when I see \"Men entered the contract and must assume responsibility.\" used when the same was not considered true of women, and was even considered an irrational, misogynistic argument. I get really bothered by the \"Biology is unfair, get over it.\" argument because that was a very central attack on women not very long ago. These kinds of arguments support giving up on the search for a better approach since, as you stated, the best we can do is choose between two evils.  I suggest that, if we've already shown that the arguments used against abortion have no basis in reasoning, we should not use the same arguments to justify an unchanging law. Instead, we should be finding a much deeper understanding of how to sort out the responsibilities of being an adult in the most unbiased way possible so that oppression/sexism/whatever else can be written out of federal laws. \n",

Broken down, one argument says, \"It's unfortunate that you're the one who happens to get pregnant, but we're both equally responsible for our actions and therefore have earned an equal say in the matter because it will affect both of us.\"  The other says, \"We're both equally responsible for our actions, but you voided your right to determine those responsibilities upon having sex because I'm the one who happens to get pregnant.\"  I'm trying to play devil's advocate for both sides, but it's like placing a monetary value on the physical burden of pregnancy.  If humans mated like fish, we'd have an equal say in the matter, but like you said, abortion gives a woman autonomy over her body, even though the man is affected as well.  Also, pregnancy lasts for 9 months while supporting a child takes much longer; there are numerous factors to consider.

One of the most important lessons in law school is that 2 smart, well meaning people can look at the exact same information and come to 2 different opinions as to what it means and what to do about it, and it's entirely possible for both to be right (or at least, not wrong!).  Historically, women had it bad - real bad. I've read a lot of court cases and they are enough to make anyone from the modern era really mad. That's a problem of course, because in correcting a legitimately bad circumstance, another bad circumstance was created.   >Instead, we should be finding a much deeper understanding of how to sort out the responsibilities of being an adult in the most unbiased way possible so that oppression/sexism/whatever else can be written out of federal laws.

I think that for us to move forward with kids' entertainment, we need to take out the princess/prince relationship element entirely. It is interesting to me that Disney almost always plays on that romantic angle (as does nearly every thing that comes out of Hollywood), whereas stories from Studio Ghibli in Japan (Hiyao Miazaki films) do not at all.

I want to point out that there is a good chance that neither Julian nor Ricky was taking home a paycheck that was anywhere near to your level of pay.  I don't know if knowing that would settle your mind or accept the situation any more than you already have.  The same government programs that facilitate getting people jobs like this also have provisions where the pay rate is literally in the slave labor zone.  This is because the job is not meant to support them fully, but is meant to keep them socially integrated into society versus locked away at home alone/with only their immediate caregivers.  The job duties and pay are a far and much less emphasized second goal in this whole concept.  Now this may sound like I have an axe to grind with these low paying programs, but I don't.  Seriously.  I see them as providing a great service.  The extremely low pay requirement incentives more employers to hire people in need, and to put up with a reasonable amount of issues that often come along with the employee.     **EDIT:**  Looks like it is not even nessisarily part of the specifc programs, but is an allowance under federal law.  In the good old US of A at least....  **\"A provision in the Fair Labor Standard Act (FLSA) of 1938 gives employers the right to pay people with disabilities below the minimum wage. At Goodwill, explains Leigland, disabled employees take a timed test to see how quickly they can sort and hang a rack of clothes. The garments must be facing to the left and the top buttons fastened and separated into men’s, women’s and children’s sections. Goodwill wants workers to be able to hang 100 garments with no errors in 32 minutes. “We can’t do it that quickly because we can’t look at a garment and see the size,” she says about her experience and her husband’s. Depending on how slow the employee works, Goodwill lowers the hourly wage.\"**\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Consider that they're \"extra\" employees. Perhaps your store only needs a little help, and they provide that little bit. They're not actually a burden, you just perceive it that way because they're not taking an equal share of the task, but the task you have is something you can handle without excess exertion, and the same goes for them.   Consider it this way. A large, strong person and a small, weak person are tasked with moving 300 lbs of stuff 100 feet. They resolve to carry it as the best method. An equal share would be 150 lbs, which the strong person would carry with relative ease (75% max load) while the weak would struggle unduly (125% max load). A more fair compromise would be perhaps a 200/100 split, or 125/175 even. Both workers will be pulling maximum output for their potential, perhaps like your store. (Though I will concede that your store may not be properly managed and they failed to take that into account, however I feel I've given you a good generalized case for how it could be fair even if in reality it is not in all situations)\n",

Your sharing of cookies ultimately leads to the bakery making money. Alternatively, if your friend is not me and can actually make food without burning down his domicile, you share the recipe with him and the market where you buy ingredients makes money (since clearly if you can replicate the taste at home, there isn't any need to go to the bakery). Either way, someone makes money as a result of the sharing of cookies.  However, when you give that same friend a ripped MP3 off of a CD, he NEVER NEEDS TO BUY ANYTHING. He can re-use that copy of the MP3 a million and one times and still have the ability to do it again.

This analogy is inaccurate.  Buying cookies and then sharing the recipe with your friend is analogous to you downloading the song, then transcribing it it to musical notation and giving the musical notation to your friend.

Whether they see money or not is irrelevant in my opinion.  Nobody deserves to make a profit.

From my perspective recorded music is no different than pictures of food on the internet.

Historically, a great way of making money from mines was to buy a bunch of slaves, throw them in it, have them dig stuff out for you regardless of the dangers, and pay them nothing for it. I suppose you'd be inclined to return to this time? What did or didn't happen historically is only relevant to the present in what mistakes we should seek to avoid making. Just because something isn't the \"traditional way\" of making money doesn't mean you shouldn't be expected to make money that way. Manufacturing wasn't a \"traditional\" way of making money, so should we deny them money by breaking into the factory and stealing all the sofas? After all, by your own argument, manufacturing is only a recent (on even the human timescale) invention, and therefore not a traditional way of making money (or sofas, for that matter), so let's go steal the damn things! Perfectly OK, right?  You argument is so self serving that it's clear you care about nothing and no one except those you consider your immediate friends, family, and property. If you have a job, you'd argue that you yourself don't deserve a profit, that you should be paid nothing for your job and you should be content with it? After all, you're making a profit when you go to your job - there's no monetary investment on your part in your job, but you get money out of it! BLASPHEMY!  > Absolutely yes.

You're not sharing photos of a cookie - even if you argue that the live experience has an extra facet of reality to it, you can't simplify that to the picture of a cookie. You're still getting the essence of the cookie out of it when you pirate MP3s - you're just not getting the whole thing. You get the taste, but not the temperature, texture, crunchiness or softeness, smell, etc. It's closer to the difference between a real cookie and a cookie-flavored milk drink. And maybe you don't pay as much for a cookie-flavored milk drink as for a cookie, but somehow I doubt you claim \"This isn't a cookie,\" grab said drink, and sprint out of the grocery store, avoiding guards and police. This is, however, what you're advocating.  Your piracy of that music denies not only the musician, but also the recording technician, the track mixer, the CD burner, the CD printer, the distributor, and the retailer money. And say what you like about musicians, but as long as those other careers have existed, they are doing what they have traditionally done in those careers to make money. \n",

      "\t\t>>\t I don't quite know.  It depends on how important you think punishing/rehabilitating/identifying actual drug users is, versus how much of a problem it is for someone to be mistakenly punished/rehabilitated/identified.  One should be able to roughly calculate the probability that the individual is a drug user with the assumption that each test is independent.  Assign a score that corresponds to \"true user\" as P(test 1's result (positive or negative) on test 1| true user) * P(test 2's result on test 2|true user)...*P(true user), and a similar score to \"true nonuser\", normalize them, and get your probabilities there.  If at any point the P(true user | test history) is so low that the expected utility of identifying and treating this individual is lower than the cost (in terms of money, inconvenience and potential reputational damage to the subject, etc.) of administering another test, cease administering tests and declare this individual a nonuser.  If at any point the P(true user | test history) is so high that the expected utility of identifying and treating this individual is higher than the cost of doing so, cease administering tests and declare this individual a user.  If neither of these things are the case, continue administering tests.  As an interesting note, depending on the number plugged in, it's entirely possible that P(true user | no test results either way) (the prior probability of drug use) is sufficiently low as to justify stopping testing before any tests are ever given, in which case the sensible public policy would be, as you say, not to administer random drug tests.  But the goodness of that policy is contingent on the numbers, which I do not know.\n",

By the same proportion (of P(test history), which is unknown and sort of a silly thing to calculate) by which the same is true for the probabilities of a true nonuser.  Since we know that P(true user | test history) + P(true nonuser | test history) = 1 (by definition, true user and true nonuser are the only possibilities), surely we can normalize them to recreate the effect of knowing P(test history) without actually needing to do so?\n",

That role has been replaced by the de facto authority of Parliament  The Crown has several private properties- Balmoral for example, and retains private income from the Duchy of Lancaster, which itself became part of Crown lands in 1399 when Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, ascended to the throne. The fact that these entities lie separate to the Crown Estates demonstrates that they occupy slightly different legal places.  This legal nuance is explained in other Commonwealth nations, such as Canada and Australia, where 'Crown land' is the term synonymous with public land.  If the monarchy was deprived of its position, it would not automatically be handed the Crown Estate. At most it would be given the Duchy of Lancaster and its private houses. The vast majority of the 'Crown lands', and thus the vast majority of the wealth, would occupy a nebulous position somewhere within the hands of the nation, I believe. I would have to defer to a higher legal authority for clarification on this point. \n",

A separate president is elected who only has ceremonial powers. In a constitutional monarchy (UK, Spain, Sweden, etc.) the same system is used except that instead of a ceremonial president there is a ceremonial monarch.  This is different from how governments are structured in the United States and countries in the Americas which have based their government off of the US. In this system, a directly elected president is both head of government and head of state at the cost of the legislative body being separate and often refusing to work with the president.  Of course you could make the Prime Minister the head of state, but that would be a radical departure from how any other western government is structured.

      "\t\t>>\t Why they would or why they wouldn't?  You need a head of state. In US-style systems the president is both head of state and head of government. They are elected separately from the legislature, and have a different dynamic with the legislature (often they don't work together because they can be from separate parties).  In the Europe-style system the legislature elects a Prime Minister who is the head of government. Then there is either a ceremonial president or a ceremonial monarch who is head of state.  The PM could also be head of state, but this would unorthodox. No other country does it that way. Some of the benefits people say of splitting head of government and head of state is that your head of state can be more of a neutral \"mascot\" that everyone can mostly agree on. The head of state in this system represents the whole country, not just one political faction.   Also, the head of government is elected by the legislature which makes sure the entire government is on the same page (compare to gridlock in the US), but this is at the expenses of a check-and-balance.

If we were to become a republic and remove the Queen of that responsibility and power, she wouldn't have her possessions either. They are entwined together.\n",

The Lords also used to act as the supreme court until the 2009 when they created a proper UK Supreme Court.  Why? As a debating club, many non-politicians from a plethora of fields are appointed who can offer different insights. They also act as a check and balance against the Commons. Remember that the Commons and Executive are fused and the Supreme Court still can't deem laws unconstitutional as there is no written constitution. There are very few other built in checks and balances compared to a US-style government. Other reasons are that as a body it is conservative, so conservative administrations like it. Also it's part of tradition -- having a bicameral legislature is how it's been done for around a thousand years so people are reluctant to get rid of it.  In effect they don't have that much power, and can be overridden by the Commons.

And as I mentioned in a previous post on this thread, you cannot judge the actions of the past with the morals of today. You can reflect on them certainly, and say that **based on today's understandings** it was wrong, but families who were granted titles or lands or whatever based on now defunct laws cannot be dismissed as being 'undeserved' of their gains, because at the time they most likely were. I admit, there are plenty of cases of gains through nepotism or similar reasoning, but some were granted titles or land for valor in battle and other such actions.  The way that you can dismiss an entire group of people in such a blasé fashion concerns me, because your way of looking at things can be applied to anything.  **All things being equal, a man who was sent to prison for falsifying a job application should never be allowed a job again, because we know they've been granted at least one undeservedly.**  **All things being equal, a woman who has an abortion should never be allowed to have children, because we know they've given up the opportunity once and they obviously hold a disregard for it.**\n",

      "\t\t>>\t I think this is he best way to sum this up. We have this horrible connotation that discrimination is always bad, but look around there's plenty of it already. We have separate bathrooms based on gender, separate schools that folks can choose to send their children to ect. The key here is equality. A women's shelter serves to make victims of abuse at the hands of men more comfortable, so in my book they're a good thing. However that is not to say we should not make these resources available to male victims of abuse in the same capacity. Unfortunately I don't really know of any male support groups for abuse survivors out there, but I think we should certainly have them.  A personal example of this that I can speak of came from my work. A little background I work at a public shooting range that in addition to holding public hours provides a number of free classes to people. Most of the classes are open to everyone but we have a few that are exclusively women's only classes. Our rationale is that when a female starts getting into firearms it can be very intimidating to shoot with a bunch of guys standing around watching. Because folks lets face it hunting and the shooting sports are primarily dominated by men. (There are tons of female shooters out there, just not near as many). So at one point we were short handed so I asked one of our volunteer instructors to come out and help. He said he could not in good conscious participate in a class that segregated by gender when there was no male equivalent (although he understood our reasoning for it). This didn't sit well with me, and made me think a lot. I started noticing that while I was helping some male customers in a shooting situation they seemed a bit put off. I'm the only girl that works at the range, and I feel that these particular men might have had some sort of aversion to me helping them. I mean stereotypically they should have been the ones who knew what they were doing, not some girl in her early twenties. I talked to my guy friends and they said that some guys might just have been embarrassed by getting instruction on what is seen as a masculine activity from a woman. Until that point I had never really thought about it, I was there to help whatever struggling shooters that needed help.   So we decided to do something about it. We now in addition to the woman's only class have a \"Guy's day at the range\" course. We didn't think it would do well but it has filled up just as quickly as the women's courses and has received good feedback! \n",

By pointing out that 40% of DV victims are men you are using data from the National Family Violence Survey, as I understand it. That fails to take into account the severity or frequency with which DV will happen. [This article](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mpj/2012%20VAW%20General%20Surveys.pdf) draws a distinction between situational couple violence and intimate terrorism. Situational couple violence is less severe and more contingent. Intimate terrorism is present consistently in relationships and much more severe, too often to the point of death. If we look at the rates for situational couple violence the gender distribution does seem fairly high. However if we look at the rates of intimate terrorism it is almost (but not entirely) exclusively men as the perpetrators and women as the victims. Both are domestic violence, but one is far less severe than the other. Both should have services to address their respective issues but it is absurd to claim that, as a general group, there are as many men in need of shelter from abuse as women.

      "\t\t>>\t >A women's shelter serves to make victims of abuse at the hands of men more comfortable, so in my book they're a good thing. However that is not to say we should not make these resources available to male victims of abuse in the same capacity.    The problem here is that it's not a slight inconvenience like needing to go to the gym across town. Much of the time that gender discriminatory shelter is the *only* shelter. Men's shelters are almost non-existent because domestic violence against men isn't a socially recognized problem. It's as if the *only* gyms were gender discriminatory and men who didn't go got the shit kicked out of them by their girlfriends. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t > A women's shelter serves to make victims of abuse at the hands of men more comfortable, so in my book they're a good thing.   I find this sentence discriminitory.  Women are definitely abused by men... but NOT JUST men.    Women's shelters help female victims of abuse.  Back in April I was writing a paper for college and I wrote it on the inequity of gender.  Here are the stats as of April 4th, 2014 as I recorded them for my paper.  >Of the 22 shelters in Utah, 7 have “women” in their name denoting that this is a safe place for women or children in crisis.  Only West jordan has a place for men and their families.  Of the 22 shelters in Utah only 1 can accomodate men and their families. (source location http://utahbar.org/bars/umba/assets/utah_domestic_violence_shelters.pdf)  When I was a victim of domestic abuse, there was no where for me to turn to for help.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t > The key here is equality.  I agree with you in spirit, but be careful here.  \"Separate is inherently unequal,\" as they said in Brown vs. BoE.  I think that may be overgeneralizing, but the point is that equality is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for \"proper\" discrimination.  You also need a good *reason* to discriminate, and that, I think, really gets to the heart of OP's question.  Now, in the 2 cases mentioned, I happen to believe that the \"reason\" requirement is amply met, but that doesn't mean it always is.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I'd say mostly the fact that segregation, \"equal but separate\", was mandated in a lot of places.

      "\t\t>>\t >\t More than 1 in 3 women (35.6%) and more than 1 in 4 men (28.5%) in the United States have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.  http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_executive_summary-a.pdf  There are ~157 million women, and 152 million men in the US  http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf  157,000,000*0.356 = 55.9 million women victims  152,000,000*0.285 = 43.6 million men victims.  43.6/(55.9+43.6)*100% = 43.8% of domestic violence victims are men.  One thing to note is that this study doesn't count a female forcing a man to have sex with her, ie made to penetrate, as rape. Thus male, and some female, victims are not included in these numbers.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I have issues with the article that you linked. Here are a few of them:  > leads us to hypothesize that it is primarily a matter of men abusing women, for at least the following reasons. First, the use of violence as one tactic in an attempt to exercise general control over one’s partner requires more than the willingness to do violence. It requires a credible threat of a damaging violent response to non-compliance (M. A. Dutton & Goodman, 2005). Such a threat is, of course, more credible coming from a man than a woman simply because of the size difference in most heterosexual couples. Second, experience with violence and individual attitudes toward violence make such threats more likely and more credible from a man than from a woman. (7)  Although this is just their hypothesis, it does come from a biased viewpoint that men are more likely to be violent... because men are more likely to be violent? That type of circular reasoning rubs me the wrong way. Further, size difference doesn't matter much; a man might (maybe) be able to knock you out more effectively, but a woman is just as capable of slapping someone as a man is.  > They found that traditional men were more likely to be involved in attacks on their partners than were non-traditional men (8)  So what, exactly, is a \"traditional man?\" The implication is \"one who is more likely to violence\" for the reasons listed in the first section that I've quoted, which again leads to the circular reasoning of \"men who are more violent are likely to be more violent, because they're more violent.\"  >When a woman slaps her Intimate husband in the heat of an argument, it is unlikely to be interpreted by him as a serious attempt to do him physical harm. Women’s violence is less likely to injure, is taken less seriously, is less likely to produce fear, and is therefore less likely either to be intended as a control tactic or to be successful as one. (8-9)  This here is *outright* ignoring of woman-on-man violence. The paper clearly brushes the impact of WoM violence under the rug.  > a view of marriage as a commitment “for better or worse,” [...] can contribute to the entrapment of women in abusive relationships. (9)  While technically true, this article completely ignores the fact that it could *also* contribute to a man feeling trapped in the relationship \"for better or worse.\"  That's just the first 9 pages, and there's already enough to discredit the paper. It's nothing but biased crap.   Don't get me wrong--I'm *all for* really reading into the data. I *wholeheartedly* agree that it's a very good tactic to read into the relationships between things, and sometimes to draw whacky, counterintuitive conclusions that nonetheless accurately describe something, and I think that doing so is the superior method of analyzing data.   However, that's not what this paper is doing. It's clearly drawing a conclusion and then fitting data to that conclusion.  EDIT: Let me rephrase something that I said. This article is mostly quoting other articles, so it's less true that \"this article is brushing things under the rug\" and more true that \"this article is a collection of quotes from *other* articles that brush the issue under the rug, and as such retains that bias.\"\n",
      "\t\t>>\t >  Men's shelters are almost non-existent because domestic violence against men isn't a socially recognized problem.  There was a push for men's shelters shortly after women's shelters really caught on. This push had support from people who had been part of getting women's shelters established. It was shut down hard by feminists and is one of the major grievances that is responsible for the negative connotations around the word feminism. It isn't so much a problem that isn't socially recognized as a problem that is heavily downplayed in order to play up the gender aspects of domestic violence against women.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Have you ever seen the data when they include more classifiers? It's rather interesting from a sociological perspective (especially in light of the arguments for focusing on women in these matters) since simply focusing on non-reciprocal abuse flips the ratio. The data on abuse in same sex relationships is similarly damning for the currently prevailing view as male-male relationships have a lower incidence of abuse than male-female relationships which in turn have a lower incidence than female-female. Of course actually looking at the data (while ignoring the definitions that are designed to artificially support existing narratives) it becomes clear that things like domestic abuse and rape are not gendered issues but human ones and thus both far harder and necessary to solve. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t >Further, size difference doesn't matter much; a man might (maybe) be able to knock you out more effectively, but a woman is just as capable of slapping someone as a man is.    Or kicking them as hard as they can in the shins, scratching, biting, throwing things, hitting people with objects, pinching, pulling, and every other painful thing people can do to one another. \n",
      "\t\t>>\t To add to the issues with using tautological reasoning and fitting data to it in this case, research into domestic violence rates found that not only are the majority of abusive relationships mutually abusive but the majority of non-reciprocally abusive relationships have a male victim and, counter to the narrative that men are violent while women are not, lesbian couples are more likely to have at least one abusive member than straight couples and gay couples are less likely (I've seen some reasonable theories as to why but all we can really go off of is the data).\n",
      "\t\t>>\t What I posted was a sociological article. As such it uses some terminology in a context which is unique to the field. For example, a traditional man is somebody who is more likely to hurt people because a traditional man is aggressive and domineering. This is not all men by ANY means whatsoever, but it is the image of masculinity that society pressures men to live up to. Traditional masculinity is hegemonic masculinity, a search term that might get you some useful articles to help in understanding the concept.   A lot of the other issues you take umbrage with are, I think, a result of a poor reading of what is being said. For instance, that first passage you reference is not saying men are more likely to be violent because they are more likely to be violent. It is saying that threats of violence are more credible coming from men because of the socializing institutions which imagine the ideal man as aggressive and the ideal woman as submissive. When a man threatens a woman, we view that as a serious threat because we have an image of how men ought to be. When a woman threatens a man, we don't take that threat seriously because that contrasts with traditional feminine gender roles. Threats of violence from men are more credible and serious because we expect them to be more credible and serious. That's all.   I grant you that this article takes a lot of things for granted, and if you have a problem with how this article defines traditional gender roles there is a wealth of academic literature of that subject. I suppose I shouldn't have assumed that a sociological article in a nonsociological subreddit would have been read from a sociological lens, though.\n",

I disagree wholeheartedly with you. You're both underestimating your girlfriend's strength and overestimating your own. If you're stronger, there will be maybe a bigger bruise, but (as someone who does martial arts and *knows* the mechanics of hitting someone in the face, I can say:) a full-force slap from your girlfriend is more than enough to give you whiplash and a full-force slap from you is nowhere near enough to do more that.

So that only reenforces the idea that a \"traditional\" (violent) man is violent because he's a violent man. That's circular reason and that's not rectified by the fact that it's an industry term.   >It is saying that threats of violence are more credible coming from men because of the socializing institutions which imagine the ideal man as aggressive and the ideal woman as submissive.  The quote says several things. 1) Men are \"credible\" sources of violence. 2) Implied: women are *not* credible sources of violence. 3) Physical size is the determining factor as to what constitutes a credible source of violence. 4) Men are inherently more experienced than women with violence.   So what does that add up to? 4, men are inherently more experienced with violence, therefore 1, men are more credible sources of violence; men are more likely to be violent because men are more violent. That's not an issue with my reading comprehension. Even if we were to argue about the word \"credible,\" which I don't care to, that still leaves the word \"serious;\" the article is clearly implying that threats from men are serious threats and threats from women are not serious threats, *even when the woman is actually hitting the man.*  As I said, I'm all for interpreting the data through whichever lens fits. But claiming that \"oh, you wouldn't understand, it's a sociological thing\" doesn't make up for the lackluster article.   Yes, traditional gender roles pidgeonhole the men into the violent role and the woman into the submissive role. But that's an idealized version of a theoretical relationship, and trying to extract data from that is like trying to extract data on real relationships from a Disney movie. \n",

He blamed the government for not giving him the funds to keep his shelter open, but he was never 'attacked' by proponents of women's shelters. He wasn't well known enough to garner their attention. His suicide note didn't say that he blamed feminists or proponents of anything, only the government.  Should men get funding, sure. But it's not really a zero sum game either. There are plenty of legitimate avenues with which to successfully lobby the government that doesn't come at the cost of women's shelters. There are men's centres, for example, popping up in Canada that haven't been met with any outcry from feminists.\n",

If victims don't feel safe, they might not get the help they need. I'd say deal with the immediate problems first, then deal with the longer-term psychological issues after.\n",

As I stated in a comment above, Silverman was pretty much off the radar for most advocacy groups because his operation was exceptionally small. His shelter was run out of his house (which was the primary reason for him not obtaining funding - because Canada and Alberta don't fund shelters run out of personal residences) and not many people even knew that it existed. The closest that he came to saying what is being alluded to by /u/phengineer is that he noticed that there were plenty of services for women but none for men. That doesn't mean, however, that he thought he wasn't getting funding because women were receiving those services.\n",

However not every browser supports the full suite of HTML5 features that might go into a complex outage map.   Their are ways to make it work and they really should invest into updating their technology. However it works and its very difficult to sell a fix for something that isn't broken. \n",

      "\t\t>>\t > first of all media queries allow you to use different images for different screen sizes, so there's no real limitation there.  Media queries are a function of CSS. You are breaking accessibility if you aren't using an img tag with alternate text to load images.\n",
      "\t\t>>\t Reddit News is a very similar style. I switched from Baconreader to Reddit News\n",
      "\t\t>>\t I used to think so, but on my phone, when viewing a link or image post, it defaults to comments and you have to click a tiny 'link' icon at the bottom.  It's annoying as shit and I uninstalled it.  \n",

      "\t\t>>\t Normally, you're correct. However, a double tap where you hold your finger down after the second tap, then moving your finger up and down as if you were scrolling, will give you a pinch-style zoom. Very effective for single-handed browsing.\n",

      "\t\t>>\t Yes, often.  This is a primary advantage of having a not-huge phone.  If you are holding something else, you can still use your phone.  I can reach every part of the screen with my thumb with the 4.3 inch screen phone I have.  If I need to type a lot, i'll go to two hands, otherwise the swype style keyboard input makes one handed typing pretty easy.\n",
