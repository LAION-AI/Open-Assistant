# This is an example of how to use RankGen to classify safe and unsafe prompts. 

This example uses some prompts writen manually. A verison will be made soon that uses hh-rlhf dataset from Anthropics.




Please look at  https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant/issues/382#issue-1519347873 for more information on the possible integration on such a system.
